+### 2025-08-16: Implement Custom Unicode Checkbox Plugin
+
+- **Actions Taken:**
+  - Replaced `markdown-it-task-checkbox` with a custom `markdown-it` plugin to render Unicode checkboxes (☐, ☑) instead of HTML `<input>` tags.
+  - This was done to prevent Matrix clients from sanitizing and removing the checkboxes.
+  - The process involved researching the `markdown-it` plugin architecture and writing a small, targeted plugin to achieve the desired result.
+- **Lessons Learned:**
+  - When a library doesn't support a specific customization, it can be more effective to write a small, custom plugin than to fight with the library's internals or use brittle regex-based solutions.
