    <h1 id="architecture">Architecture</h1>

<p>The architecture of Morpheum is designed to be decentralized, flexible, and extensible. It is based on two main components: the Matrix network for communication and collaboration, and the GitHub platform for code management and version control.</p>

<h2 id="core-components">Core Components</h2>

<h3 id="1-matrix-network">1. Matrix Network</h3>

<p>The Matrix network is a decentralized and federated real-time communication protocol. It is used in Morpheum as the primary communication channel between humans and AI agents.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Project Rooms:</strong> Each project in Morpheum has a dedicated room on the Matrix network. This room serves as the central hub for all project-related communication, including discussions, status updates, and notifications.</li>
  <li><strong>Human-Agent Interaction:</strong> Humans interact with AI agents in the project room by sending commands and queries. Agents respond with text, images, and other media. A significant part of an agent’s response to a request or task involves creating a project fork, committing changes, and submitting a pull request for human review and merging.</li>
  <li><strong>Decentralization and Federation:</strong> The federated nature of Matrix allows for a decentralized and resilient communication infrastructure. Users can run their own Matrix homeservers, giving them full control over their data and communication.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-github-platform">2. GitHub Platform</h3>

<p>GitHub is a web-based platform for software development and version control using Git. It is used in Morpheum as the primary platform for code management, collaboration, and CI/CD.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Code Repositories:</strong> Each project in Morpheum has a dedicated repository on GitHub. This repository contains the project’s source code, documentation, and other assets.</li>
  <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> Git is used for version control, allowing for a distributed and non-linear workflow. Developers can work on their own forks of the repository and submit pull requests to contribute their changes.</li>
  <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> GitHub provides a rich set of tools for collaboration, including issue tracking, code reviews, and project management boards.</li>
  <li><strong>CI/CD:</strong> GitHub Actions is used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). This allows for automated testing, building, and deployment of the project.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>

<p>The typical workflow for a project in Morpheum is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Project Creation:</strong> A new project is initiated by creating a room on the Matrix network and a corresponding repository on GitHub.</li>
  <li><strong>Team Formation:</strong> Humans and AI agents are invited to join the project room on Matrix.</li>
  <li><strong>Task Decomposition:</strong> The project is broken down into smaller tasks, which are assigned to either humans or AI agents.</li>
  <li><strong>Development:</strong> Developers work on their assigned tasks, using Git for version control and GitHub for collaboration.</li>
  <li><strong>Communication:</strong> All project-related communication takes place in the project room on Matrix.</li>
  <li><strong>Review and Approval:</strong> Pull requests are reviewed by humans, who can then instruct an AI agent to perform the mechanics of approving and merging the pull request.</li>
  <li><strong>CI/CD:</strong> GitHub Actions is used to automate the testing, building, and deployment of the project.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="extensibility">Extensibility</h2>

<p>The architecture of Morpheum is designed to be extensible. New AI agents, tools, and services can be easily integrated into the ecosystem.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>AI Agents:</strong> New AI agents can be developed and deployed to assist with a wide range of tasks.</li>
  <li><strong>Hardware Providers:</strong> A marketplace of hardware providers can be created to provide the computing resources for running the AI agents.</li>
  <li><strong>Third-Party Integrations:</strong> Morpheum can be integrated with other third-party services, such as project management tools, code analysis services, and deployment platforms.</li>
</ul>
