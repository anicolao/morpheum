# Design Proposals

This section contains active and archived design proposals for the Morpheum project. Design proposals help us make thoughtful architectural decisions and track the evolution of the project.

## Active Proposals

### Project Tracking and Management Enhancement

- **Status**: Under Review
- **Type**: Infrastructure Enhancement
- **Description**: Evaluation of GitHub's native project management features to enhance visibility and collaboration while preserving the Matrix-centric workflow.

## Proposal Process

### How to Submit a Proposal

1. **Discussion**: Start with a discussion in the Matrix room
2. **Documentation**: Create a detailed proposal document
3. **Review**: Community and maintainer review
4. **Decision**: Approval or revision recommendations
5. **Implementation**: If approved, implementation planning begins

### Proposal Template

All proposals should include:

- **Problem Statement**: What challenge are we addressing?
- **Proposed Solution**: How will we solve it?
- **Alternatives Considered**: What other options were evaluated?
- **Implementation Plan**: How will this be built?
- **Impact Assessment**: What are the benefits and risks?

## Approved Designs

### Matrix-Centric Architecture

- **Approved**: Q3 2024
- **Status**: Implemented
- **Description**: Foundation architecture using Matrix for communication and GitHub for code management

### AI Agent Framework

- **Approved**: Q4 2024
- **Status**: In Development
- **Description**: Core framework for AI agent integration and management

## Implementation Status

| Proposal | Status | Phase | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|-------|
| Matrix Architecture | âœ… Complete | v0.1 | Foundation established |
| AI Agent Framework | ðŸš€ In Progress | v0.2 | Core capabilities developed |
| GitHub Pages Site | ðŸš€ In Progress | v0.2 | This site is part of implementation |
| Enhanced GitHub Integration | ðŸ“‹ Planned | v0.3 | Pending v0.2 completion |

## Historical Decisions

### Architecture Decisions

- **Matrix over Discord**: Chose Matrix for decentralization and federation benefits
- **Jekyll over Custom Site**: Selected Jekyll for simplicity and GitHub Pages integration
- **TypeScript over JavaScript**: Adopted TypeScript for better development experience

### Design Principles

These principles guide our design decisions:

1. **Preserve Matrix-Centric Workflow**: Don't replace, enhance
2. **Maintain Decentralization**: Avoid vendor lock-in
3. **Prioritize Human Oversight**: AI assists, humans decide
4. **Keep It Simple**: Prefer simple solutions over complex ones
5. **Document Everything**: All decisions should be traceable

## Contributing to Design

### Design Discussion Channels

- **Matrix Room**: Real-time design discussions
- **GitHub Issues**: Formal proposal tracking
- **GitHub Discussions**: Community feedback and Q&A

### Review Criteria

Proposals are evaluated based on:

- Alignment with project vision
- Technical feasibility
- Community benefit
- Implementation complexity
- Maintenance burden
