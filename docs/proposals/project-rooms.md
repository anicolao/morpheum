# Project Rooms Design Proposal

**Status**: Under Review  
**Type**: Feature Enhancement  
**Date**: {{ site.time | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}

## Quick Summary

This proposal introduces a new `!project create` command that allows users to create dedicated Matrix rooms for specific GitHub projects with automatic GitHub Copilot integration.

## Problem Statement

Currently, Morpheum users interact with AI agents in general-purpose Matrix rooms without project-specific context. This makes it difficult to:

- Maintain project-focused conversations
- Automatically configure AI tools for specific repositories
- Organize collaboration around specific GitHub projects
- Track project-specific development progress

## Proposed Solution

Add a new command: `!project create git@github.com:user/projectname` that:

1. Creates a dedicated Matrix room named after the project
2. Automatically invites the requesting user
3. Configures the bot for GitHub Copilot integration with the specified repository
4. Sets up appropriate room permissions and context

## Key Benefits

- **Focused Collaboration**: Project-specific rooms for targeted discussions
- **Automatic Configuration**: No manual setup of repository context
- **Seamless Integration**: Leverages existing GitHub Copilot capabilities
- **Scalable Organization**: Multiple projects can coexist without interference

## Technical Approach

The implementation leverages:

- Existing Matrix bot SDK for room creation and management
- Current GitHub Copilot integration for repository-specific AI assistance
- Matrix room state events for persistent configuration storage
- Proven command pattern used by other bot features

## Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1**: Core room creation and user invitation
2. **Phase 2**: GitHub Copilot integration and room configuration
3. **Phase 3**: Enhanced security, rate limiting, and user experience
