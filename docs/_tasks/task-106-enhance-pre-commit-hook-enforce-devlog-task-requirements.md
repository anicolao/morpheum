title: "Enhance Pre-commit Hook to Enforce Devlog and Task Entry Requirements"
order: 106

phase: development

## Objective
Fix the pre-commit hook to enforce that every commit includes both a devlog entry and a task entry, addressing the issue that PR 92 bypassed workflow requirements.

## Requirements
1. **Clean up test artifacts**: Remove test content from DEVLOG.md and test_file.txt from previous commits
2. **Enhance pre-commit hook**: Add logic to require both devlog and task entries for every commit
3. **Smart detection**: Allow documentation-only commits to proceed without devlog/task requirements
4. **Clear messaging**: Provide actionable error messages when requirements are missing
5. **Maintain existing protections**: Keep the current prevention of direct DEVLOG.md/TASKS.md editing

## Implementation Details

### File Cleanup
- ✅ Reverted DEVLOG.md to remove erroneous "test" line at line 57
- ✅ Removed test_file.txt that was accidentally committed

### Pre-commit Hook Enhancement
- ✅ Added detection for devlog files in `docs/_devlogs/`
- ✅ Added detection for task files in `docs/_tasks/`
- ✅ Implemented smart logic to exempt documentation-only commits
- ✅ Enhanced error messaging with specific requirements and guidance
- ✅ Maintained existing legacy file protection

### Logic Flow
1. Check for unstaged changes and untracked files (existing)
2. Prevent direct editing of DEVLOG.md and TASKS.md (existing)
3. **NEW**: For non-documentation commits, require:
   - At least one file in `docs/_devlogs/`
   - At least one file in `docs/_tasks/`
4. Provide clear error messages for missing requirements

## Testing Strategy
- Test that hook blocks commits missing devlog entries
- Test that hook blocks commits missing task entries  
- Test that hook allows documentation-only commits
- Test that hook still prevents legacy file editing
- Verify error messages are clear and actionable

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Pre-commit hook enforces devlog entry requirement
- ✅ Pre-commit hook enforces task entry requirement
- ✅ Documentation-only commits are allowed to proceed
- ✅ Clear error messages guide users on missing requirements
- ✅ Existing legacy file protections remain intact

## Status: Completed
The pre-commit hook has been successfully enhanced to enforce both devlog and task entry requirements for every commit, while maintaining flexibility for documentation-only changes.
