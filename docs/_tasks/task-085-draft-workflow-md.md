### Description

As a prerequisite to implementing changes to the `!llm status` command and overall bot interaction model, a `WORKFLOW.md` document needs to be drafted. This document will outline the intended user experience for interacting with bots in a project room, ensuring alignment on the design before implementation begins.

### Acceptance Criteria

- A `WORKFLOW.md` file is created in the root directory.
- The document details the user journey, including the new behavior of the `!llm status` command.
- The document is submitted for user review via a pull request.
