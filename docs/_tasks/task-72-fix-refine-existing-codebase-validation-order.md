- [x] **Fix refine-existing-codebase gauntlet task validation order**
  - [x] Analyzed issue #97 where the task was failing due to incorrect execution order
  - [x] Identified root cause: validation code was creating initial server.js file AFTER bot execution, overwriting bot's modifications
  - [x] Moved file creation from validation phase (successCondition) to setup phase (before bot execution)
  - [x] Added pre-task setup logic specifically for refine-existing-codebase task
  - [x] Preserved all existing validation logic (endpoint testing, JSON response validation)
  - [x] Verified fix with comprehensive testing - all tests pass
  - [x] Ensured minimal, surgical changes with no impact on other gauntlet tasks
