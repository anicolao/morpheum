- [x] **Ad Hoc: Fix Deep Linking in Copilot Session Started Message (Issue #42)**
  - [x] Identified issue where 'Copilot session started' message used generic
        `https://github.com/copilot/agents` URL instead of deep linking to
        session details
  - [x] Modified `formatStatusUpdate` method to use issue-specific URLs when
        available but no PR exists yet
  - [x] Updated test expectations to verify deep linking to GitHub issue URL
  - [x] Maintained backward compatibility with existing URL fallback logic
  - [x] Verified fix with comprehensive test suite ensuring all functionality
        remains intact
