This task creates a comprehensive design document that outlines how Slack integration would work for Morpheum while preserving its core Matrix-based, federated architecture. The design uses a bridge pattern that maintains the existing Matrix ecosystem while providing Slack compatibility for teams that prefer or require Slack as their collaboration platform.

**Key Design Features:**
- **Bridge Architecture:** Maintains Matrix core while adding Slack compatibility layer
- **Full Feature Parity:** All existing bot capabilities available through Slack interface
- **Security First:** Comprehensive authentication, encryption, and access control design
- **Real Examples:** Detailed code samples and workflow demonstrations
- **Migration Path:** Smooth transition strategy for teams adopting Slack
- **Implementation Plan:** Phased 16-week roadmap with concrete milestones

**Impact:** This design enables Morpheum to expand to Slack-native teams while preserving its decentralized, federated principles and maintaining compatibility with existing Matrix-based workflows.
