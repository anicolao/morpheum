- [x] **Ad Hoc: Fix Markdown Link Rendering in Copilot Streaming Messages (Issue #40)**
  - [x] Identified root cause: Copilot streaming chunks with markdown links were sent as plain text instead of formatted HTML
  - [x] Added `hasMarkdownLinks()` helper function to detect markdown links in text chunks using regex pattern
  - [x] Modified Copilot streaming callback to route chunks with markdown to HTML formatting using existing `sendMarkdownMessage()` helper
  - [x] Created comprehensive test suite to verify markdown detection, HTML formatting, and end-to-end streaming behavior
  - [x] Ensured fix is surgical and targeted - only affects Copilot status messages with GitHub links, preserves all existing functionality
  - [x] All 106 tests passing, confirming no regressions introduced
  - [x] **Follow-up: Refactored function naming based on user feedback**
    - [x] Enhanced existing `sendMarkdownMessage()` function to automatically detect markdown content instead of creating new `sendMessageSmart()` function
    - [x] Avoided function naming changes to reduce cognitive overhead and merge conflict potential
    - [x] Generalized markdown detection to include links, code blocks, bold, italic, and headings
    - [x] Replaced all message sending calls to use enhanced smart detection while preserving existing function names
    - [x] All 110 tests continue to pass with comprehensive markdown support
