- [ ] **Enhanced GitHub Pages Interface Implementation**
  - [ ] Update `docs/status/tasks.md` with task statistics dashboard
  - [ ] Add filtering and search UI elements (search input, status filter, phase filter)
  - [ ] Implement basic CSS styling for task interface
  - [ ] Create `docs/api/tasks.json` API endpoint for programmatic access
  - [ ] Add JavaScript-based client-side filtering functionality
  - [ ] Test the enhanced interface works correctly on GitHub Pages

This task implements the first phase of the Issue Management System as outlined in ISSUE_MANAGEMENT.md. It focuses on enhancing the GitHub Pages task interface to provide better visibility and searchability of tasks while maintaining backward compatibility with the existing system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Task dashboard shows statistics (open tasks, completed tasks, active phases)
- Users can search tasks by title and content
- Users can filter tasks by status and phase
- All existing task URLs continue to work
- The page gracefully degrades if JavaScript is disabled
