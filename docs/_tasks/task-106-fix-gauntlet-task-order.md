- [x] **Fix gauntlet task execution order**
  - [x] Analyzed issue #105 requiring task order swap: create-project-dir should be 1st, add-jq should be 3rd
  - [x] Identified current problematic order: add-jq (1st), check-sed-available (2nd), create-project-dir (3rd)
  - [x] Implemented solution by reordering task objects in gauntlet tasks array
  - [x] New logical order: create-project-dir (1st), check-sed-available (2nd), add-jq (3rd)
  - [x] Added comprehensive tests to verify and maintain correct task ordering
  - [x] Verified all existing functionality preserved (220 tests pass)
  - [x] Confirmed logical dependency resolution: /project directory created before tasks that use it
