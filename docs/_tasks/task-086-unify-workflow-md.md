### Description

After creating an initial `WORKFLOW.md`, a second version was provided by Copilot. This task is to critically analyze both versions, identify the strengths of each, and synthesize them into a single, comprehensive `WORKFLOW.md` that is better than either individual document.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Both versions of `WORKFLOW.md` are analyzed.
- A new, unified `WORKFLOW.md` is created, merging the best ideas from both.
- The new document is submitted on a new branch for final review.
