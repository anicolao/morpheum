## Task: Bug - bun install doesn't successfully install the matrix library

**Status:** Pending

**Description:**
The Matrix library fails to install properly when using `bun install`, preventing the bot from functioning correctly when using bun as the package manager. This blocks the adoption of bun as the primary package manager for the project.

**Problem:**
- Matrix library installation fails with bun
- Bot functionality is broken when dependencies installed via bun
- Forces use of npm for installation despite bun preference
- Inconsistent dependency resolution between package managers

**Requirements:**
- Matrix library should install successfully with bun
- All Matrix-related functionality should work with bun-installed dependencies
- Identify and resolve bun-specific installation issues
- Maintain compatibility with npm installation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `bun install` successfully installs matrix library without errors
- [ ] Matrix bot functionality works with bun-installed dependencies
- [ ] No conflicts between bun and npm dependency resolution
- [ ] Bot can connect to Matrix servers using bun-installed libraries
- [ ] CI/CD can use bun for dependency installation
