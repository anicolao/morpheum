- [x] **Fix Gauntlet Provider Validation Logic**
  - [x] Identified issue where gauntlet command was checking current provider instead of requested provider
  - [x] Analyzed that the early check in `handleGauntletCommand` was blocking valid gauntlet executions
  - [x] Removed incorrect check for `this.currentLLMProvider === 'copilot'` since gauntlet creates its own bot instance
  - [x] Verified that existing argument parsing already prevents copilot from being specified as `--provider`
  - [x] Updated tests to reflect corrected behavior - gauntlet can run regardless of current provider
  - [x] Added test coverage for edge cases: openai provider when current is copilot, and blocking explicit copilot requests
  - [x] Validated fix ensures gauntlet works with any valid provider (openai/ollama) regardless of bot's current state
