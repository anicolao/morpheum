## Task: Bug - design needed for creating and tracking issues

**Status:** Pending

**Description:**
The current system lacks a clear design for how issues should be created and tracked throughout their lifecycle. This leads to inconsistent issue management, unclear workflows, and difficulty in project tracking and prioritization.

**Problem:**
- No standardized process for issue creation
- Unclear issue tracking workflows
- Inconsistent issue categorization and labeling
- Difficulty in project progress tracking
- Lack of clear issue lifecycle management

**Requirements:**
- Design comprehensive issue creation workflow
- Define issue tracking and lifecycle management
- Establish consistent categorization and labeling system
- Create templates for different issue types
- Integrate with existing project management tools

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Issue creation workflow is documented and standardized
- [ ] Issue tracking system design is complete
- [ ] Issue templates are created for different types (bug, feature, task)
- [ ] Labeling and categorization system is defined
- [ ] Integration with GitHub Projects/other tools is designed
- [ ] Issue lifecycle states and transitions are documented
- [ ] Workflow accommodates both manual and automated issue creation
