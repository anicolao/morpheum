- [x] **Task 45: Deprecate Old Integration**

  - [x] Once the new `!swe` command is stable, remove the old Gemini CLI
        integration code and the `!gemini` command from
        `src/morpheum-bot/index.ts`.
  - [x] Remove any other now-unused files or dependencies related to the old
        implementation.
