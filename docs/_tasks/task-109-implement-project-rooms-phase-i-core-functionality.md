- [x] **Task 109: Implement Project Rooms Phase I - Core Functionality**

  - [x] Created Git URL parser supporting SSH, HTTPS, and short GitHub URL formats
  - [x] Implemented ProjectRoomManager class for Matrix room creation and management
  - [x] Added user invitation functionality with comprehensive error handling
  - [x] Integrated `!project create` and `!project help` commands into bot command structure
  - [x] Updated main help command to include project room functionality

  - [x] Created welcome messages for newly created project rooms

**Implementation Details:**
- Git URL Parser: Handles git@github.com:user/repo, https://github.com/user/repo, and user/repo formats
- Room Creation: Uses matrix-bot-sdk with custom state events for project configuration
- Error Handling: User-friendly messages for invalid URLs, room creation failures, and invitation issues
- Integration: Seamless integration with existing bot command structure and token refresh logic

**Files Created:**
- `src/morpheum-bot/git-url-parser.ts` (with comprehensive tests)
- `src/morpheum-bot/project-room-manager.ts` (with comprehensive tests)
- `src/morpheum-bot/bot-project-commands.test.ts` (integration tests)
- Updated `src/morpheum-bot/bot.ts` and `src/morpheum-bot/index.ts`

This completes Phase I as specified in PROJECT_ROOMS.md design document. Ready for Phase II implementation focusing on enhanced Copilot integration and security features.
