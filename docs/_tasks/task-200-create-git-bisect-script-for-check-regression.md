order: 200
status: completed
phase: "Development Tools"
category: "Quality Assurance"
---

- [x] Analyze repository structure and understand what check.sh should contain
- [x] Create a check.sh script that represents typical CI/quality checks (TypeScript compilation + tests)
- [x] Ensure check.sh fails on current main to confirm there's a regression (93 TypeScript errors found)
- [x] Create find-check-hash.sh script that uses git bisect to find the failing commit
- [x] Make both scripts executable and implement robust error handling
- [x] Improve bisect script to handle single-commit scenarios and grafted repositories
- [x] Test the bisect script to ensure it works correctly across git history
- [x] Verify script outputs the first failing commit hash as requested
- [x] Document usage and edge cases for future maintenance
