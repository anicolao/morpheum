- [x] **Task 20: Automate Model Building with a Generic Makefile**

  - [x] Establish a `<model-name>.ollama` convention for model definition files.
  - [x] Implement a `Makefile` that uses Ollama's internal manifest files for
        dependency tracking.
  - [x] Use a generic pattern rule in the `Makefile` to automatically discover
        and build any `*.ollama` file.
