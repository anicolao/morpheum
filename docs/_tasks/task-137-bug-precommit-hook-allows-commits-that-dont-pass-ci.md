## Task: Bug - precommit hook allows commits that don't pass CI

**Status:** Pending

**Description:**
The pre-commit hook is not properly validating that commits will pass CI before allowing them to be committed. This leads to commits being pushed that later fail in CI, breaking the build process and requiring additional commits to fix.

**Problem:**
- Pre-commit hook allows commits that don't meet CI requirements
- CI failures occur after commits are already pushed
- Broken builds in the main branch
- Additional overhead to fix CI failures post-commit

**Requirements:**
- Pre-commit hook should validate the same checks that CI performs
- Hook should prevent commits that would fail CI
- Maintain fast pre-commit hook execution time
- Provide clear error messages when validation fails

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Pre-commit hook runs the same validation as CI
- [ ] Commits that would fail CI are blocked locally
- [ ] Hook execution time remains reasonable (< 30 seconds)
- [ ] Clear error messages guide developers on how to fix issues
- [ ] Documentation updated with pre-commit hook requirements
