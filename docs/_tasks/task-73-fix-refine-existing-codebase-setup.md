- [x] **Fix refine-existing-codebase gauntlet task setup**
  - [x] Analyzed issue #99 where setupContainer failed due to missing /project directory and flake.nix
  - [x] Identified that `nix develop` commands require a flake.nix file in the working directory
  - [x] Modified setupContainer to create /project directory using `mkdir -p /project`
  - [x] Added comprehensive flake.nix creation with all required tools (bun, jq, sed, python+requests, curl, which, hugo)
  - [x] Preserved existing server.js creation logic exactly as before
  - [x] Verified fix with comprehensive testing - all tests continue to pass
  - [x] Ensured minimal, surgical changes with no impact on other gauntlet tasks
  - [x] Made refine-existing-codebase task self-sufficient and no longer dependent on create-project-dir task
