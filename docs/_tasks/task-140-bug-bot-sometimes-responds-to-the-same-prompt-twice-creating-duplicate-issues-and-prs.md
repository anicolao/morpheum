## Task: Bug - bot sometimes responds to the same prompt twice, creating duplicate issues and PRs

**Status:** Pending

**Description:**
The bot occasionally processes the same user prompt multiple times, resulting in duplicate GitHub issues and pull requests being created. This creates noise in the project and wastes resources.

**Problem:**
- Bot processes the same prompt multiple times
- Duplicate GitHub issues are created
- Duplicate pull requests are generated
- Resource waste and project noise
- Confusion for users and maintainers

**Requirements:**
- Implement deduplication mechanism for bot prompts
- Prevent multiple responses to the same input
- Handle edge cases like network retries gracefully
- Maintain responsive bot behavior for legitimate requests

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Bot responds only once to each unique prompt
- [ ] Deduplication works across bot restarts
- [ ] No duplicate GitHub issues or PRs are created
- [ ] Edge cases (network issues, retries) are handled properly
- [ ] Bot remains responsive to legitimate new prompts
- [ ] Logging includes deduplication information for debugging
