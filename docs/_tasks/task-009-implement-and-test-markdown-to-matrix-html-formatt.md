- [x] **Task 9: Implement and Test Markdown to Matrix HTML Formatting**

  - [x] Create a new test suite for markdown formatting logic
        (`src/morpheum-bot/format-markdown.test.ts`).
  - [x] Write a test case for converting basic markdown (headings, bold,
        italics) to Matrix-compatible HTML.
  - [x] Write a test case for handling markdown code blocks (fenced and
        indented).
  - [x] Write a test case for converting markdown lists (ordered and unordered)
        to HTML.
  - [x] Implement the core `formatMarkdown` function that converts markdown text
        to the HTML format required by Matrix.
  - [x] Ensure all tests pass and the output is correctly formatted for Matrix
        messages.
