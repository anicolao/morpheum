- [x] **Task 7: Create `jail/README.md`**
  - Create a `README.md` file inside the `jail` directory.
  - Document how to use the new scripts (`start-vm.sh`, `build.sh`, `run.sh`,
    and `agent.ts`) to set up and interact with the jailed environment. This
    replaces the manual instructions in the original prototype document.
