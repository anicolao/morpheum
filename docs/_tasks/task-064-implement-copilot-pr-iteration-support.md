- [x] **Task 64: Implement Copilot PR Iteration Support**

  - [x] Added smart iteration detection to identify when users want to apply PR review comments or address feedback on existing work
  - [x] Implemented regex-based keyword matching for natural language variations like "apply review comments", "address feedback", "iterate on PR"
  - [x] Added existing work finder to locate open Copilot issues and associated PRs for iteration
  - [x] Created session continuation functionality to add iteration comments to existing issues instead of creating new ones
  - [x] Maintained full backward compatibility - falls back to creating new sessions when iteration detection fails
  - [x] Added comprehensive test coverage for iteration detection, existing work finding, and session continuation
  - [x] Enhanced number extraction to handle various PR/issue reference formats (#123, PR 123, issue #456)
  - [x] Verified all existing tests continue to pass, ensuring no regression in current functionality

  **Impact**: Users can now efficiently iterate on Copilot tasks by applying PR review comments without creating unnecessary new issues and PRs, reducing overhead and maintaining better task continuity.
