title: "Fix git bisect implementation to handle missing scripts in older commits"
order: 202
status: completed
phase: implementation

## Description

Address the issue where `git bisect run` fails when the test script doesn't exist in older commits being tested. This was causing the find-check-hash.sh script to fail with "command not found" errors.

## Solution

Implement a temporary script approach that:
- Creates a test script in `/tmp` that persists across git checkouts  
- Includes proper cleanup with trap handlers
- Maintains full git bisect functionality without fallback to manual loops

## Implementation

- Modified find-check-hash.sh to use temporary test script
- Added proper error handling and cleanup
- Ensured consistent git bisect usage throughout

## Status: âœ… Completed

The script now properly uses git bisect in all cases, addressing the feedback to "always use git bisect" while handling the technical challenge of missing scripts in older commits.
