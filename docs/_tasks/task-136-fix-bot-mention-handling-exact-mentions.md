## Task: Fix bot mention handling to only respond to exact mentions

**Status:** Completed ✅

**Issue:** #136

**Description:**
Bot should only respond to explicit mentions to the exact name of the bot, rather than similar names or partial matches. The current implementation responds to any message that starts with the bot's name, causing unwanted responses to partial matches.

**Problem:**
- Bot responds to partial matches like "morph" when bot name is "morpheus"
- Bot responds to similar names like "morpheusbot123" 
- No delimiter requirement after bot name
- Creates noise and unexpected bot behavior

**Requirements:**
- Only respond to exact bot name matches
- Require proper delimiters (space, colon, comma, etc.) after bot name
- Maintain backward compatibility with commands starting with "!"
- Preserve existing functionality for legitimate mentions

**Implementation:**
- Modified mention detection logic in `src/morpheum-bot/index.ts`
- Changed from `startsWith()` to exact matching with delimiter checks
- Added support for multiple delimiters: space, colon, comma, tab, newline
- Added helpful behavior for bare mentions (shows help)
- Created comprehensive test suite (31 new tests)

**Testing:**
- `src/morpheum-bot/mention-handling.test.ts` - Core mention logic tests
- `src/morpheum-bot/bot-mention-integration.test.ts` - Integration tests
- All 317 existing tests continue to pass
- Manual verification confirms correct behavior

**Files Modified:**
- `src/morpheum-bot/index.ts` - Main implementation
- `src/morpheum-bot/mention-handling.test.ts` - Test suite
- `src/morpheum-bot/bot-mention-integration.test.ts` - Integration tests

**Behavior Changes:**
- ✅ Responds to: `morpheus help`, `morpheus: task`, `morpheus,`, `MORPHEUS task`, `morpheus` (shows help)
- ❌ No longer responds to: `morph help`, `morpheusbot123`, `supermorpheus`, `morpheushelp`
- ✅ Commands unchanged: `!help`, `!tasks`, etc. work exactly as before

**Result:**
Bot now provides precise mention detection, eliminating unwanted responses while maintaining full functionality for legitimate mentions and commands.
