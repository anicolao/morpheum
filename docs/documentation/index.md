# Documentation

Welcome to the Morpheum documentation. Here you'll find everything you need to understand, contribute to, and work with the Morpheum project.

## Getting Started

- [**Developer Onboarding**](onboarding/) - Complete guide for new team members

- [**Architecture Overview**](architecture/) - Understanding how Morpheum works
- [**Contributing Guide**](contributing/) - How to contribute to the project

## Core Concepts

Morpheum is built around several key concepts that enable seamless collaboration between humans and AI agents:

### Shared Context
Morpheum provides a shared understanding of the project for both humans and AI agents. This includes the codebase, project goals, and current status.

### Task Decomposition
Complex development tasks can be broken down into smaller, manageable units that can be assigned to either AI agents or human developers.

### AI-Assisted Development
Morpheum integrates with powerful AI coding agents to automate repetitive tasks, generate code, and provide intelligent suggestions.

### Human-in-the-Loop
Human developers are always in control. They can review, modify, and approve the work of AI agents, ensuring the quality and integrity of the codebase.
