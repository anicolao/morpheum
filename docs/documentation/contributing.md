# Contributing to Morpheum

We welcome contributions to the Morpheum project! By contributing, you help us build a more collaborative and efficient software development ecosystem.

## How to Contribute (Matrix-Centric Workflow)

All human interaction and contribution to Morpheum projects are designed to occur primarily within dedicated Matrix rooms. AI agents will handle the underlying Git mechanics (forking, branching, committing, and creating pull requests) based on human instructions.

### 1. Understand the Vision and Architecture

Before you start, please familiarize yourself with the project's vision and architecture:

- **[Vision Document](../vision/)**: Understand the long-term goals and philosophy of Morpheum.
- **[Architecture Overview](../architecture/)**: Learn about the core components and how they interact.
- **[Project Status](/status/)**: See what we're currently working on and our near-term plans.

### 2. Development Environment

The development environment is actively transitioning to a Matrix-driven workflow. While local development is still used for complex tasks, the primary mode of interaction is intended to be through the project's Matrix room. All interactions, including code changes, are increasingly initiated by instructing the Morpheum bot. AI agents, each with their own GitHub accounts, will manage the forks and pull requests based on these instructions.

### 3. Find and Define a Task

- **Check the [Project Status](/status/)**: Look for tasks that align with your skills and interests.
- **Browse Issues**: Check the GitHub issues for open tasks. These issues will typically be managed and updated by AI agents based on discussions in the Matrix room.
- **Propose a New Feature/Bug Fix**: If you have an idea for a new feature or a bug fix, initiate a discussion in the relevant Matrix room. An AI agent will then create a formal GitHub issue based on this discussion.

### 4. Instruct AI Agents to Make Changes

Instead of directly manipulating Git, human contributors will instruct AI agents within the Matrix room to perform the necessary actions:

1. **Task Assignment**: Describe the task or change you want to implement
2. **Agent Execution**: AI agents will create forks, implement changes, and submit pull requests
3. **Human Review**: Review the AI-generated code and provide feedback
4. **Iteration**: Work with agents to refine the implementation
5. **Approval**: Once satisfied, approve the pull request for merging

### 5. Types of Contributions

We welcome various types of contributions:

- **Code**: New features, bug fixes, performance improvements
- **Documentation**: Improvements to guides, API docs, and examples
- **Testing**: Test cases, integration tests, and quality assurance
- **Design**: UX/UI improvements and design proposals
- **Community**: Helping other contributors, answering questions

### 6. Code Quality Guidelines

- **Follow existing patterns**: Maintain consistency with the current codebase
- **Write tests**: Include appropriate test coverage for new features
- **Document changes**: Update relevant documentation
- **Use clear commit messages**: Follow conventional commit format
- **Handle errors gracefully**: Implement proper error handling

### 7. Review Process

1. **AI-Generated PR**: Agents create pull requests based on your instructions
2. **Automated Testing**: CI/CD pipelines run tests automatically
3. **Human Review**: Core contributors review the code changes
4. **Feedback Loop**: Iterate on feedback through Matrix discussions
5. **Merge**: Approved changes are merged to the main branch
