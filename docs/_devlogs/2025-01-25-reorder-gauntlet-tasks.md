## Actions Taken

- **Problem Analysis**: Analyzed issue #105 requesting to swap the order of "add-jq" and "create-project-dir" gauntlet tasks
- **Current Order Identified**: Found tasks were ordered as add-jq (1st), check-sed-available (2nd), create-project-dir (3rd)
- **Required Change**: Need create-project-dir to be 1st and add-jq to be 3rd to maintain proper difficulty progression
- **Implementation**: 
  - Swapped the positions of "add-jq" and "create-project-dir" task objects in the tasks array
  - Maintained "check-sed-available" in the 2nd position
  - New order: create-project-dir (1st), check-sed-available (2nd), add-jq (3rd)
- **Testing**: Added comprehensive tests to verify task ordering and ensure no regressions

## Friction/Success Points

- **Success**: Simple and surgical change - only reordered existing task objects in the array
- **Success**: All existing tests continue to pass (220 tests) with no breaking changes
- **Success**: Added 4 new tests specifically for task order verification
- **Success**: Logical ordering improvement - tasks now arranged by increasing difficulty rather than arbitrary order
- **Success**: Pre-commit hooks guided proper documentation workflow

## Technical Learnings

- **Task Difficulty Ordering**: Gauntlet tasks should be ordered by increasing difficulty, not by dependencies. Each task runs in a fresh container, so container dependencies don't apply.
- **Task Simplicity**: `create-project-dir` is simpler than `add-jq` because creating a directory is more straightforward than understanding Nix package management.
- **Test-Driven Verification**: Added specific tests to ensure task ordering remains correct in the future
- **Minimal Changes**: Demonstrated that reordering array elements is a safe, minimal change that preserves all functionality
- **Documentation Requirements**: Pre-commit hooks enforce proper documentation standards for all changes
