    - **Jekyll Collections:** Properly configured in `_config.yml` with working aggregation pages
    - **Content Migration:** All 171 historical entries successfully migrated (per Jan 30 migration devlog)
    - **Legacy File Cleanup:** TASKS.md and DEVLOG.md replaced with workflow documentation
    - **Documentation Updates:** CONTRIBUTING.md and AGENTS.md updated with new workflow
