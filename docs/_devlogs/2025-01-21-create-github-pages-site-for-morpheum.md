    visual inspiration and following guidance from PROJECT_TRACKING_PROPOSAL.md.

- **Actions Taken:**

    directory with the recommended structure from the project tracking proposal
  - **Design System:** Developed custom CSS inspired by the project logo, using
    a blue color palette and clean, professional styling
  - **Content Migration:** Created comprehensive documentation pages based on
    existing project markdown files:
    - Landing page with project vision and key features
    - Getting Started guide for new contributors
    - Architecture overview explaining the Matrix/GitHub design
    - Contributing guide with Matrix-centric workflow
    - Vision document and Agent guidelines
    - Project status with current roadmap and milestones
    - Design proposals section for architectural decisions
  - **Automation:** Set up GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment from
    main branch
  - **Jekyll Configuration:** Configured Jekyll with proper theme, plugins, and
    navigation structure
  - **AGENTS.md Update:** Added instructions for AI agents to maintain the
    GitHub Pages site alongside code changes

- **Friction/Success Points:**

  - **Success:** Jekyll provided a clean, simple framework that integrates well
    with GitHub Pages
  - **Success:** The existing documentation was well-structured and easy to
    adapt for the website
  - **Success:** The blue color palette from the logo created a cohesive,
    professional appearance
  - **Success:** The responsive design works well on both desktop and mobile
    devices
  - **Learning:** GitHub Pages requires specific directory structure and
    configuration for Jekyll builds

- **Lessons Learned:**
  - GitHub Pages with Jekyll provides an excellent foundation for project
    documentation websites
  - Preserving the Matrix-centric philosophy while creating public-facing
    documentation helps maintain project consistency
  - Automated deployment via GitHub Actions ensures the site stays current with
    repository changes
  - Including agent guidelines in public documentation helps establish clear
    expectations for AI collaboration
