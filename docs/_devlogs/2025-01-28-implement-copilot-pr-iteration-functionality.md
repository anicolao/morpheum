# Implement Copilot PR Iteration Functionality

## High-Level Request

Fix the GitHub Copilot integration so that when users want to iterate on a task by applying PR review comments, the system reuses the existing issue and PR instead of creating a completely new issue and PR every time.

## Actions Taken

### Analysis
- **Problem Identification**: The current `startCopilotSession()` method always creates new issues and PRs, even when users want to iterate on existing work
- **Code Review**: Examined existing methods like `getActiveSessions()` and identified the need for smart iteration detection
- **Test Coverage**: Analyzed existing test coverage to understand integration patterns

### Solution Implementation
- **Iteration Detection**: Added `detectIterationRequest()` method with regex patterns to identify when prompts are asking to iterate on existing work
- **Keyword Patterns**: Implemented flexible regex patterns for phrases like "apply review comments", "address feedback", "iterate on PR", etc.
- **Existing Work Finder**: Added `findExistingWorkForIteration()` method to locate existing Copilot issues and PRs
- **Session Continuation**: Implemented `continueExistingSession()` method to add iteration comments to existing issues
- **Backward Compatibility**: Modified `startCopilotSession()` to check for iteration first, then fall back to new session creation

### Key Changes Made
1. **Enhanced Pattern Matching**: Used regex patterns instead of simple string matching for better flexibility
2. **Number Extraction**: Added robust extraction of PR and issue numbers from prompts
3. **Graceful Fallback**: Maintained full backward compatibility with existing behavior
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Added focused tests for iteration detection and session continuation

## Friction/Success Points

### Success Points
- **Test-Driven Development**: All existing tests continued to pass, ensuring backward compatibility
- **Flexible Pattern Matching**: Regex-based approach handles natural language variations effectively
- **Clean Architecture**: New functionality integrates seamlessly with existing codebase
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests cover multiple iteration scenarios and edge cases

### Lessons Learned
- **Regex Patterns vs String Matching**: Initial approach using simple string matching failed for natural language variations like "address the feedback" vs "address feedback"
- **Test Helper Methods**: Adding public test methods (`_testDetectIterationRequest`) improved testability without exposing internal implementation
- **Mock Strategy**: Proper mock setup was crucial for testing the iteration flow without hitting real GitHub APIs

### Technical Challenges
- **Pattern Complexity**: Balancing specificity and flexibility in regex patterns for natural language processing
- **Number Extraction**: Handling various formats for PR/issue references (e.g., "#123", "PR 123", "issue #456")
- **Mock Configuration**: Setting up complex mock scenarios to test the full iteration workflow

## Technical Details

The implementation adds smart iteration detection that:

1. **Detects Iteration Intent**: Uses regex patterns to identify when users want to iterate on existing work
2. **Finds Existing Work**: Searches for existing open Copilot issues and associated PRs
3. **Continues Sessions**: Adds iteration comments to existing issues instead of creating new ones
4. **Maintains Compatibility**: Falls back to existing behavior when iteration detection fails

**Key Methods Added:**
- `detectIterationRequest()`: Analyzes prompts for iteration keywords and extracts references
- `findExistingWorkForIteration()`: Locates existing Copilot issues/PRs for iteration
- `continueExistingSession()`: Adds iteration comments to existing issues
- `_testDetectIterationRequest()`: Public test helper for iteration detection

**Example Workflow:**
```
User: "apply review comments from PR #123"
System: → Detects iteration request
       → Finds existing issue linked to PR #123
       → Adds iteration comment to existing issue
       → Copilot works on existing PR instead of creating new one
```

This eliminates the overhead of creating new issues/PRs for iteration tasks while maintaining full backward compatibility.
