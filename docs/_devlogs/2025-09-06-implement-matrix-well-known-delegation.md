## High-Level Request

Read MATRIX_SETUP.md and implement the necessary changes to modify the GitHub Pages part of the repository to report the correct Matrix homeserver delegation values.

## Actions Taken

### Analysis and Setup
- **Repository Structure Understanding**: Analyzed the current GitHub Pages setup using Jekyll with docs/ as the source directory
- **MATRIX_SETUP.md Review**: Read the documentation which specified the need for `.well-known/matrix/client` file for Matrix homeserver delegation
- **Identified Target Domain**: Current GitHub Pages site serves from `anicolao.github.io/morpheum` based on _config.yml

### Implementation
- **Created Directory Structure**: Added `docs/.well-known/matrix/` directory for Matrix delegation files
- **Matrix Client Configuration**: Created `docs/.well-known/matrix/client` file with proper JSON content:
  ```json
  {
      "m.homeserver": {
          "base_url": "https://matrix.morpheum.dev"
      }
  }
  ```
- **Jekyll Configuration**: Updated `docs/_config.yml` to include `.well-known` directory in Jekyll build process by adding:
  ```yaml
  include:
    - .well-known
  ```
- **Documentation Fix**: Corrected malformed markdown link syntax in MATRIX_SETUP.md where the JSON example had `"[https://matrix.morpheum.dev](https://matrix.morpheum.dev)"` instead of proper `"https://matrix.morpheum.dev"`

### Validation
- **JSON Syntax**: Validated the client file contains valid JSON using `python3 -m json.tool`
- **File Structure**: Verified the directory structure and file placement matches MATRIX_SETUP.md requirements
- **Git Integration**: Successfully committed and pushed changes to the PR branch

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed
- Matrix .well-known delegation file created and properly configured
- Jekyll configuration updated to serve .well-known files
- Documentation corrected to show proper JSON format
- Changes committed and pushed to PR branch

### ⏳ Pending
- **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Workflow triggered but requires manual approval for PR deployments (expected security behavior)
- **Endpoint Verification**: Once deployed, the Matrix delegation should be accessible at `https://anicolao.github.io/morpheum/.well-known/matrix/client`

## Technical Details

### Matrix Delegation Configuration
The implementation follows the Matrix specification for client discovery delegation:
- **Purpose**: Allows Matrix clients to discover the homeserver at `matrix.morpheum.dev` when users try to log in with `@username:morpheum.dev` addresses
- **Standard Compliance**: Uses the standard `.well-known/matrix/client` endpoint as specified in Matrix MSC1929
- **JSON Structure**: Contains the required `m.homeserver.base_url` field pointing to the actual homeserver

### Jekyll Integration
- **File Inclusion**: Jekyll by default excludes dot-files, so the `include: [.well-known]` directive ensures the directory is processed and served
- **Content Type**: Jekyll will serve the file with appropriate headers for JSON content discovery

## Expected Outcome

When deployed and merged to main:
1. Matrix clients will be able to perform homeserver discovery via `https://morpheum.dev/.well-known/matrix/client` (once custom domain is configured)
2. Users can log in with `@username:morpheum.dev` addresses and clients will automatically discover the homeserver at `matrix.morpheum.dev`
3. The delegation setup enables the clean separation between user-facing domain and actual homeserver location

## Next Steps

- Wait for PR approval and merge to main branch for deployment to production
- Verify the endpoint works correctly after deployment
- Consider adding custom domain configuration if `morpheum.dev` domain will be used instead of `anicolao.github.io/morpheum`
