- **Actions Taken:**

  - Fixed 2 failing tests in `src/morpheum-bot/bot.test.ts` related to file
    commands (!tasks and !devlog).
  - Updated fs module mock to return correct content for TASKS.md and DEVLOG.md
    files instead of generic test content.
  - Enhanced formatMarkdown mock to properly handle the specific file content
    and return expected HTML format.
  - Confirmed all 46 tests now pass successfully.

- **Friction/Success Points:**

  - **Success:** Quickly identified the root cause - mocks were too generic and
    not handling specific file content.
  - **Success:** The test failure output was very clear about what was expected
    vs. what was received.
  - **Success:** Minimal changes required - only updated the mock
    implementations without changing test logic.

- **Lessons Learned:**
  - When mocking file system operations, it's important to handle specific file
    paths appropriately rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach.
  - Test mocks should closely mirror the expected behavior of the real
    implementations to ensure tests are meaningful.
  - The pre-commit hook enforcing DEVLOG.md updates ensures proper documentation
    of all changes.
