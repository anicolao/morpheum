- **Actions Taken:**
  - Pushed the `gemini-cli` submodule changes to its remote repository using
    `git push --recurse-submodules=on-demand`.
  - Identified the repeated process failure of forgetting to update
    [`DEVLOG.md`](DEVLOG.md).
  - Installed and configured `husky` to manage Git hooks in a way that is
    persistent across different development environments.
  - Created a `pre-commit` hook that checks if both [`DEVLOG.md`](DEVLOG.md) and
    [`TASKS.md`](TASKS.md) have been modified and staged. If not, the commit is
    aborted.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - A local `pre-commit` hook was initially proposed, but the user correctly
    pointed out that `husky` would be a more robust, repository-wide solution.
  - Successfully implemented the `husky` hook, which provides a systemic
    solution to a recurring human/agent error.
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - Process failures should be addressed with systemic solutions, not just
    promises to improve. Using tools like `husky` to enforce development
    conventions is a powerful way to improve reliability.
  - Forgetting to push submodule changes is a common error. The
    `--recurse-submodules=on-demand` flag is a useful tool to ensure they are
    pushed along with the parent repository.
