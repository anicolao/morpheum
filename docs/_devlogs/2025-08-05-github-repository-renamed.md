- **Actions Taken:**
  - The GitHub repository was successfully renamed from `morpheus` to `morpheum`
    using the `gh repo rename` command.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - The CLI previously incorrectly stated that this operation required manual
    intervention, highlighting a limitation in the CLI's knowledge base
    regarding `gh` CLI capabilities.
