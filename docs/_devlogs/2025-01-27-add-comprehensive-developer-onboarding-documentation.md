## High-Level Request

Create a comprehensive onboarding document for new developers joining the Morpheum project, starting with the basic Matrix setup steps mentioned in issue #118 and expanding with additional useful information for new team members.

## Actions Taken

**Created ONBOARDING.md document** with comprehensive guidance covering:
- Matrix account creation (multiple homeserver options)
- Security setup (recovery keys, passphrases, cross-signing)
- Profile verification best practices
- Bot invitation and configuration
- Troubleshooting section for "bot not responding to messages" issue
- Development environment setup
- Matrix-first workflow explanation
- Project-specific commands and resources

**Integrated with documentation ecosystem:**
- Added Jekyll page at docs/documentation/onboarding.md
- Updated documentation index to include onboarding guide
- Updated README.md to reference onboarding as first step
- Updated CONTRIBUTING.md to point new contributors to onboarding guide

**Validated implementation:**
- All tests continue to pass (273 tests passed)
- All referenced documentation files exist
- Markdown formatting and internal links verified

## Friction/Success Points

**Success Points:**
- Found well-structured existing documentation that provided good context
- Project's directory-based documentation system prevents merge conflicts
- Comprehensive test suite caught no regressions
- Jekyll integration allows seamless web presentation

**Friction Points:**
- Pre-commit hooks require devlog and task entries (discovered during commit)
- Need to understand project's Matrix-centric workflow for accurate documentation

## Technical Learnings

**Documentation Architecture:**
- Project uses Jekyll with `include_relative` to reference root markdown files
- Directory-based system in `docs/_devlogs/` and `docs/_tasks/` prevents conflicts
- YAML front matter required for automatic aggregation into unified views

**Matrix Integration:**
- Bot commands like `!project create` for GitHub repository rooms
- Troubleshooting section addresses common bot connectivity issues
- Security considerations for Matrix account setup are crucial

**Project Workflow:**
- Matrix-first collaboration with AI agents handling GitHub operations
- Human oversight and review remain central to the development process
- Comprehensive onboarding reduces friction for new team members
