- **Actions Taken:**

  - Conducted comprehensive review of all markdown files for inconsistencies
    with current project state
  - Added deprecation notices to `GEMINI_CLI_OVERVIEW.md` and
    `JAIL_PROTOTYPE.md` since Gemini CLI was removed and jail system is now
    implemented
  - Updated `AGENTS.md` to reflect actual npm usage instead of preferred but
    unavailable bun
  - Updated `README.md` "Getting Started" section to reflect current v0.2
    project state rather than early conceptual phase
  - Updated references in `TASKS.md` to clarify that jail prototype tasks have
    been completed
  - Preserved historical context by marking outdated files as deprecated rather
    than deleting them

- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - **Success:** Following established pattern from previous DEVLOG entries to
    preserve history rather than delete outdated content
  - **Success:** Identified clear inconsistencies between documented vs actual
    package management, project state, and implemented features
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - Documentation consistency reviews are essential as projects evolve rapidly
  - Deprecation notices are preferable to deletion for maintaining historical
    context
  - Package manager preferences in documentation should match available tooling
