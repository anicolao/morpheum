- **Actions Taken:**
  - Performed an editing pass on this [`DEVLOG.md`](DEVLOG.md) file to make it
    briefer and less formal, without losing any content. Reduced word count from
    700 to 500 words.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - Obtaining the previous word count required instructing the Gemini CLI to use
    `git show` and then count words, highlighting a current friction point in
    fully automated metrics gathering.
