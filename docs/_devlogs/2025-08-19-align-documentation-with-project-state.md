- **Actions Taken:**

  - Read all project markdown files to identify inconsistencies between the
    documented plans and the actual state of the project.
  - Discovered that `ROADMAP.md` was significantly outdated and did not reflect
    the completion of the initial bot setup (v0.1).
  - Updated `ROADMAP.md` to mark v0.1 tasks as complete, preserving the project
    history, and added a new v0.2 section outlining the current focus on agent
    evaluation and enhancement.
  - Updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` to clarify that the Matrix-driven workflow is the
    current, active development process, not a future goal.

- **Friction/Success Points:**

  - **Success:** The process of reading the documentation and git log allowed
    for a clear and accurate update, bringing the project narrative in line with
    reality.
  - **Friction:** I initially proposed deleting the outdated sections, but the
    user correctly pointed out that preserving the history and marking items as
    complete is a better approach. I also forgot to include the `TASKS.md` and
    `DEVLOG.md` updates in the original commit plan, which was a process
    failure.

- **Lessons Learned:**
  - Project documentation, especially roadmaps, must be treated as living
    documents and updated regularly to reflect progress.
  - Preserving the history of completed work in a roadmap is valuable for
    understanding the project's trajectory.
  - Adherence to the project's own contribution process (i.e., updating
    `TASKS.md` and `DEVLOG.md`) is critical for all contributors, including the
    AI agent.
