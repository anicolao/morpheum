## Actions Taken

### Problem Analysis
- Analyzed feedback from @anicolao that the pre-commit hook was not enforcing the requirement for both devlog and task entries on every commit
- Identified that the current hook only prevented editing legacy DEVLOG.md and TASKS.md files but didn't require new entries
- Found and cleaned up test artifacts from previous commit (test line in DEVLOG.md and test_file.txt)

### File Cleanup
- Reverted DEVLOG.md to remove erroneous "test" line at line 57 (from commit e17173d)
- Removed test_file.txt that shouldn't have been committed

### Pre-commit Hook Enhancement
- Enhanced `.husky/pre-commit` to require both devlog and task entries for every commit
- Added logic to detect documentation-only commits and exempt them from the requirement
- Improved error messaging to clearly explain missing requirements
- Maintained existing protections against direct DEVLOG.md/TASKS.md editing

### Key Features Added
- **Smart Detection**: Distinguishes between code changes and documentation-only changes
- **Clear Messaging**: Provides specific guidance on what's missing and how to fix it
- **Flexible Requirements**: Allows documentation-only commits to proceed without devlog/task entries
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Checks for both devlog entries in `docs/_devlogs/` and task entries in `docs/_tasks/`

## Friction/Success Points

### Success Points
- Successfully identified and cleaned up test artifacts from previous commits
- Enhanced pre-commit hook with clear, actionable error messages
- Maintained backward compatibility while adding new enforcement

### Friction Points
- Had to carefully analyze git history to understand what needed to be reverted
- Required balancing strict enforcement with practical workflow considerations (documentation-only commits)

## Technical Learnings

### Pre-commit Hook Design Patterns
- Learned importance of staging area inspection using `git diff --cached --name-only`
- Discovered effective patterns for providing clear, actionable error messages in git hooks
- Understanding of when to be strict vs. flexible in workflow enforcement

### Git History Management
- Practiced selective file reversion using `git checkout <commit>~1 -- <file>`
- Learned to verify changes are correctly reverted using `git diff`

## Next Steps

- Test the enhanced pre-commit hook to ensure it works as expected
- Update corresponding task to reflect completion of this work
- Monitor for any edge cases or issues with the new enforcement logic
