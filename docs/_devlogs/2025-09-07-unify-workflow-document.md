### Actions Taken

1.  After iterating on a `WORKFLOW.md` document, the user provided a link to a second version of the document created by another agent (Copilot).
2.  My task was to critically analyze both versions and merge them into a single, superior document.
3.  I used `view_text_website` to fetch the content of the Copilot version from its pull request on GitHub.
4.  **Analysis:**
    -   **Copilot's Version:** Had a more comprehensive structure, with more sections (like `Future Considerations`) and more concrete examples.
    -   **My Version:** Had a more refined and user-approved workflow for two key interactions: the `!status` command and the planner-led delegation model.
5.  **Synthesis:**
    -   I used Copilot's document as the base structure due to its comprehensive nature.
    -   I replaced Copilot's section on bot discovery with my more detailed `!status` command specification, as this was a core user requirement.
    -   I enhanced Copilot's `Bot-to-Bot Collaboration` section by adding my "Planner-Led Delegation" workflow as a specific, advanced pattern.
    -   The result is a new `WORKFLOW.md` that combines the broad structure of Copilot's version with the detailed, user-refined interaction models from my version.
6.  Created a new task (`task-086-unify-workflow-md.md`) and this devlog entry to document the synthesis work.

### Friction/Success Points

*   **Success:** This was a great example of collaborative design. By combining the outputs of two different agents, we produced a document that is more thorough and well-rounded than either would have been alone.
*   **Friction:** Parsing the content from the GitHub PR's HTML output required careful inspection, but was manageable. A direct link to the raw file would have been slightly easier.

### Technical Learnings

*   When synthesizing information from multiple sources, it's effective to use the most comprehensive source as a "base" and then strategically inject or merge the more refined or specific details from other sources.
*   This task highlights the importance of being able to not just create content, but to analyze, compare, and synthesize it with other sources of information.
