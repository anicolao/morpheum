## High-Level Request

Address comprehensive review feedback on PR #119 ONBOARDING.md to fix incorrect instructions and remove unnecessary sections.

## Actions Taken

**Applied all 12 review feedback items:**

1. **Fixed Element.io UI instructions**: Changed from "click Get started" to "hover over 'Sign in' and click on 'Open element web'"
2. **Removed unnecessary Morpheum homeserver option**: Removed the entire team members homeserver section
3. **Corrected Security Key Setup location**: Fixed path from "Settings → Security & Privacy" to "Settings → Encryption" 
4. **Fixed button name**: Changed from "Secure Backup" to "Setup Recovery Key"
5. **Removed incorrect step**: Eliminated reference to non-existent "Secure Backup" setup
6. **Removed Recovery Passphrase section**: Completely removed as unnecessary
7. **Updated verification process**: Changed to "Click the user's profile picture and click 'Verify user'"
8. **Removed Team Member Verification section**: Eliminated entire section per feedback
9. **Simplified bot section**: Removed invitation steps, kept only `!help` suggestion since project room already has bot
10. **Removed troubleshooting section**: Eliminated entire "Step 5: Troubleshooting Bot Issues" section - fix issues instead
11. **Fixed package manager preference**: Put `bun install # preferred` first, npm second
12. **Removed Project-Specific Commands**: Eliminated unnecessary Step 8 section

**Updated related documentation:**
- Created Jekyll integration page at `docs/documentation/onboarding.md`
- Updated documentation index to include onboarding guide
- Updated README.md to reference onboarding as first step  
- Updated CONTRIBUTING.md to point new contributors to onboarding guide

## Friction/Success Points

**Success Points:**
- All review feedback was clear and actionable
- Applied changes systematically following review order
- Maintained document flow while removing sections
- Integration with existing documentation system worked smoothly

**Friction Points:**
- Had to manually construct ONBOARDING.md from PR patch due to branch access issues
- Required careful attention to not break markdown formatting when removing sections

## Technical Learnings

**Review Process:**
- GitHub review comments provide line-by-line feedback for precise improvements
- Following reviewer feedback order helps ensure nothing is missed
- Some feedback items require removing entire sections, not just edits

**Documentation Integration:**
- Jekyll `include_relative` directive allows referencing root markdown files
- Directory-based documentation system requires creating devlog and task entries
- Cross-references between documentation files need to be maintained when making changes

**Matrix UI Details:**
- Element.io interface specifics matter for accurate user instructions
- Settings location paths change between Element versions
- Button names should match exactly what users see in the interface
