- **Actions Taken:**

  - **Documentation Update:** Added comprehensive section to `CONTRIBUTING.md` explaining the new directory-based approach for tasks and devlogs

  - **Front Matter Examples:** Provided complete examples of required YAML front matter for both task and devlog entries
  - **Navigation Updates:** Ensured users understand how entries automatically appear on unified pages
  - **Workflow Documentation:** Explained how the new system eliminates merge conflicts while preserving the unified view
