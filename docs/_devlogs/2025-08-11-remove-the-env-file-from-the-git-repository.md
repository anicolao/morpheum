- **Actions Taken:**
  - A `.env` file containing secrets was incorrectly committed to the
    repository.
  - Added `.env` to the `.gitignore` file to prevent future commits.
  - Executed `git rm --cached .env` to remove the file from the Git index while
    keeping the local file.
  - Committed the changes to `.gitignore` and the removal of the tracked file.
  - Pushed the changes to the `upstream/main` branch to ensure the secret is no
    longer in the remote repository's history.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - The initial attempt to add `.env` to `.gitignore` resulted in a malformed
    entry. This was corrected by reading the file, identifying the error, and
    using the `replace` tool.
  - Successfully removed the sensitive file from the repository, closing a
    potential security vulnerability.
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - Always double-check the contents of `.gitignore` after modification.
  - Never commit secrets or environment-specific files to a Git repository. Use
    `.gitignore` to explicitly exclude them.
  - When a secret is accidentally committed, it's not enough to just delete it
    and commit. You must remove it from the history using tools like
    `git rm --cached` or more advanced history rewriting tools if necessary.
