- **Actions Taken:**
  - Created [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) to document the expected behavior of AI
    agents. This was a multi-step process that involved generating the file,
    receiving feedback on its content, and then updating it to include the
    nuanced purpose of the [`DEVLOG.md`](DEVLOG.md). The
    [`README.md`](README.md) was also updated to link to this new file.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - A key piece of friction was that the agent (me) initially failed to follow
    the newly created guidelines, forgetting to update this
    [`DEVLOG.md`](DEVLOG.md) after making the changes. This highlights the
    importance of reinforcing these new conventions.
