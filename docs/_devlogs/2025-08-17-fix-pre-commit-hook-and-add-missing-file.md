- **Actions Taken:**

  - Investigated why the pre-commit hook failed to prevent a commit that was
    missing the `JAIL_PROTOTYPE.md` file.
  - Discovered the existing hook only checked for unstaged changes in a specific
    subdirectory (`src/morpheum-bot`), not the entire repository.
  - Improved the `.husky/pre-commit` script to be more robust by adding two
    comprehensive checks:
    1. A check for any unstaged modifications to already-tracked files
       (`git diff`).
    2. A check for any new, untracked files that are not in `.gitignore`
       (`git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`).
  - Staged the improved hook and the previously missed `JAIL_PROTOTYPE.md` file.
  - Confirmed the new hook works as expected by having it correctly block a
    commit attempt that was missing a `DEVLOG.md` update.

- **Friction/Success Points:**

  - The process failure (missing a file) directly led to a valuable process
    improvement (a more robust pre-commit hook).
  - The new hook provides a much stronger guarantee that all changes are
    intentionally included in a commit.

- **Lessons Learned:**
  - Process automation, like pre-commit hooks, must be general and
    comprehensive. A check that is too specific can create a false sense of
    security.
  - It's important to test the automation itself. The failed commit attempt
    served as a perfect live test of the new hook.
