- **High-Level Request:**

  - Extend the morpheum-bot to support both OpenAI API and Ollama API, allowing
    users to switch between different LLM providers based on their needs, with
    comprehensive testing and documentation.

- **Actions Taken:**

  - **OpenAI Integration:**
    - Completed the existing Task 34 by implementing a full `OpenAIClient` class
      that follows the same patterns as `OllamaClient`.
    - Created comprehensive test suite covering all OpenAI functionality
      including error handling, custom base URLs, and various response
      scenarios.
    - Un-skipped the existing `openai.test.ts` and expanded it significantly.
  - **Common Interface Design:**
    - Created `LLMClient` interface to abstract differences between providers.
    - Implemented factory pattern in `llmClient.ts` for creating appropriate
      clients based on configuration.
    - Updated both `OpenAIClient` and `OllamaClient` to implement the common
      interface.
  - **Bot Enhancement:**
    - Major refactor of `MorpheumBot` to support dual APIs with automatic
      provider selection.
    - Added new commands: `!llm status`, `!llm switch`, `!openai <prompt>`,
      `!ollama <prompt>`.
    - Enhanced help system with comprehensive command documentation.
    - Implemented configuration via environment variables for both providers.
  - **Architecture Improvements:**
    - Updated `SWEAgent` to use generic `LLMClient` interface instead of being
      tied to Ollama.
    - Added support for OpenAI-compatible APIs via custom base URL
      configuration.
    - Implemented robust error handling and validation throughout.
  - **Testing & Documentation:**
    - Created 46 passing tests across 5 new/updated test files.
    - Added comprehensive documentation in `MORPHEUM_BOT_API.md` with usage
      examples.
    - Updated `TASKS.md` to mark Task 34 as completed.

- **Friction/Success Points:**

  - **Success:** The existing codebase had excellent patterns to follow - the
    `OllamaClient` implementation provided a clear template for the
    `OpenAIClient`.
  - **Success:** The test infrastructure was already well-established, making it
    easy to add comprehensive test coverage.
  - **Success:** The bot's command structure was extensible, allowing seamless
    integration of new LLM commands.
  - **Success:** Environment variable-based configuration made it easy to
    support both providers without breaking existing setups.
  - **Friction:** Had to navigate some existing test failures (2 in
    format-markdown) that were unrelated to the changes, but successfully
    isolated the new functionality.
  - **Success:** The interface-based approach made the integration very clean
    and maintainable.

- **Lessons Learned:**
  - **Interface Design:** Creating a common interface early (`LLMClient`) made
    it trivial to swap providers and will make future LLM integrations much
    easier.
  - **Factory Pattern:** The factory pattern (`createLLMClient`) provides
    excellent extensibility for adding new providers in the future.
  - **Environment-based Configuration:** Using environment variables for
    configuration provides flexibility while maintaining security (API keys
    aren't hardcoded).
  - **Comprehensive Testing:** Having both unit tests and integration tests
    gives confidence that the dual-API approach works correctly.
  - **Documentation-First:** Creating `MORPHEUM_BOT_API.md` with usage examples
    makes the new functionality immediately accessible to users.
  - **Backward Compatibility:** Maintaining the original `sendOpenAIRequest`
    function ensures existing code won't break while providing the new
    class-based API.
