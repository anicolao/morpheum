- **Actions Taken:**
  - Made two improvements to [`VISION.md`](VISION.md): a minor rephrasing for
    conciseness in the "Project Scaffolding" bullet, and a more significant
    correction to clarify that human developers will need to adapt to new,
    AI-mediated workflows for interacting with version control systems, rather
    than using "familiar workflows."
