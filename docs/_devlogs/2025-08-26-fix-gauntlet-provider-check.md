## Actions Taken

- **Identified Issue**: The gauntlet command was incorrectly checking the bot's current provider instead of the requested provider argument
- **Root Cause Analysis**: The `handleGauntletCommand` method had an early check `if (this.currentLLMProvider === 'copilot')` that blocked gauntlet execution regardless of what provider was requested
- **Code Changes**: Removed the problematic early check since gauntlet creates its own bot instance with the specified provider
- **Test Updates**: Modified tests in both `bot.test.ts` and `gauntlet.integration.test.ts` to reflect the corrected behavior

## Friction/Success Points

**Success Points:**
- The existing argument parsing already prevented copilot from being specified as `--provider`, so the fix only required removing the incorrect check
- Comprehensive test suite made it easy to verify the fix worked correctly
- Clear separation between "current provider" and "requested provider" concepts helped identify the issue

**Technical Learnings:**
- The gauntlet creates a new MorpheumBot instance and calls `configureForGauntlet(model, provider)` rather than using the main bot's current configuration
- The early provider check was redundant since argument parsing already validates the provider
- Understanding the distinction between the bot's current state vs. the gauntlet's execution context was key to the fix

## Technical Details

**Before Fix:**
```typescript
// This blocked gauntlet even when requesting valid providers
if (this.currentLLMProvider === 'copilot') {
  await sendMessage('Error: Gauntlet cannot be run with Copilot provider...');
  return;
}
```

**After Fix:**
- Removed the early check entirely
- Argument parsing continues to validate that `--provider` must be 'openai' or 'ollama'
- Gauntlet can now run regardless of the bot's current provider state

**Test Coverage:**
- Added test verifying gauntlet works with openai provider even when current provider is copilot
- Added test ensuring copilot is still blocked when explicitly requested as `--provider`
- Updated existing test to reflect the corrected behavior
