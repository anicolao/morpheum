- **Actions Taken:**
  - Identified and corrected a significant, and _repeated_, error in the
    [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) where the Gemini CLI's implementation language
    was consistently misrepresented. Initially, it was incorrectly assumed to be
    Python-based, then incorrectly stated that a Python bot would _use_ it. The
    Gemini CLI is primarily TypeScript/JavaScript. The
    [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) has now been updated to reflect that the Morpheum
    Bot will be developed in TypeScript/JavaScript, directly leveraging the
    forked Gemini CLI codebase.
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - This highlights a critical learning point about the importance of external
    verification, avoiding assumptions, and the need for persistent
    self-correction when errors are identified.
