## High-Level Request

Fix the GitHub Pages deployments that were failing due to Jekyll build errors.

## Actions Taken

### Problem Analysis
- **Root Cause Identification**: GitHub Pages workflow runs were failing during the Jekyll build step with multiple errors:
  1. YAML frontmatter syntax errors in devlog files due to unescaped quotes
  2. Missing Jekyll layout files (task.html and devlog.html) 
  3. Invalid include_relative path trying to access files outside docs directory

### Solution Implementation
- **Fixed YAML Frontmatter Errors**: Corrected quotes-within-quotes syntax errors in two devlog files:
  - `2025-08-05-project-renaming-morpheus-to-morpheum.md`
  - `2025-08-05-typo-investigation-morpheum-to-morpheus.md`
- **Created Missing Layout Files**: Added Jekyll layout templates:
  - `docs/_layouts/task.html` - Layout for task collection items with metadata display
  - `docs/_layouts/devlog.html` - Layout for devlog collection items with metadata display
- **Fixed Include Path**: Updated `docs/documentation/onboarding.md` to properly include ONBOARDING.md from _includes directory instead of using invalid relative path

### Key Changes Made

```yaml
# BEFORE: Broken YAML frontmatter
title: "Project Renaming ("Morpheus" to "Morpheum")"

# AFTER: Valid YAML frontmatter  
title: "Project Renaming (Morpheus to Morpheum)"
```

```html
<!-- Created missing layout files -->
<!-- docs/_layouts/task.html -->
<!-- docs/_layouts/devlog.html -->
```

```liquid
<!-- BEFORE: Invalid include path -->
{% include_relative ../../ONBOARDING.md %}

<!-- AFTER: Valid include path -->
{% include ONBOARDING.md %}
```

## Friction/Success Points

### Success Points
- **Quick Problem Identification**: Successfully identified all three root causes from Jekyll build error logs
- **Comprehensive Fix**: Addressed YAML syntax, missing layouts, and invalid paths in single commit
- **YAML Validation**: Verified fixes with Python YAML parser before deployment

### Lessons Learned
- **Jekyll Include Paths**: Jekyll include_relative cannot access files outside the docs directory for security
- **YAML Escaping**: Quotes within quoted strings must be handled carefully in YAML frontmatter
- **Layout Requirements**: Jekyll collections require corresponding layout files to render properly

## Technical Details

The fixes address three categories of Jekyll build failures:

1. **YAML Syntax Errors**: Removed unescaped quotes from title fields that were breaking YAML parsing
2. **Missing Layout Files**: Created semantic HTML layouts with proper metadata display for task and devlog collections
3. **Security Restrictions**: Moved ONBOARDING.md to _includes directory to comply with Jekyll's path restrictions

This should resolve the GitHub Pages deployment failures and allow documentation updates to deploy automatically.
