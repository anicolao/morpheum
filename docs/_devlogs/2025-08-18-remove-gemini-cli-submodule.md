- **Actions Taken:**

  - Confirmed that there were no remaining code dependencies on the `gemini-cli`
    submodule.
  - Updated the pre-commit hook to remove the check for the submodule's push
    status.
  - Updated the `vitest.config.js` and `vitest.config.ts` files to remove the
    submodule from the exclusion list.
  - De-initialized and removed the `gemini-cli` submodule from the repository
    using the standard `git submodule deinit` and `git rm` commands.

- **Friction/Success Points:**

  - The process was straightforward as the previous refactoring had successfully
    decoupled the bot's logic from the submodule.

- **Lessons Learned:**
  - A clean separation of concerns makes it much easier to manage and remove
    dependencies as a project evolves.
