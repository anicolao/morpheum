## Problem Statement

Investigating why pre-commit hooks didn't prevent PR 92 from being committed without following the established workflow for DEVLOG.md and TASKS.md files.

## Root Cause Analysis

Found that the repository was using Husky v9.1.7 but with a deprecated v8-style configuration:

1. **Deprecated Hook Structure**: The `.husky/_/pre-commit` file contained only deprecated wrapper code that didn't execute our custom pre-commit logic
2. **Missing Call to Custom Script**: Git was looking for hooks in `.husky/_/` but the actual pre-commit file wasn't calling our custom `.husky/pre-commit` script
3. **Husky v9 Migration**: The repository wasn't properly migrated to Husky v9's simpler structure

## Actions Taken

- **Fixed Hook Configuration**: Updated `.husky/_/pre-commit` to properly call our custom `.husky/pre-commit` script
- **Tested Hook Functionality**: Verified that the hook now properly:
  - Blocks attempts to edit DEVLOG.md and TASKS.md directly
  - Provides clear error messages explaining the directory-based workflow
  - Allows normal commits to proceed without issues
  - Continues to check for unstaged changes and untracked files

## Technical Implementation

**Before (Broken):**
```sh
#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname "$0")/h"
```

**After (Fixed):**
```sh
#!/usr/bin/env sh
.husky/pre-commit
```

## Testing Results

1. ✅ Hook correctly blocks DEVLOG.md modifications with helpful error message
2. ✅ Hook correctly blocks TASKS.md modifications  
3. ✅ Normal commits (not touching legacy files) proceed successfully
4. ✅ Hook continues to enforce staging requirements for all changes
5. ✅ Error messages provide clear guidance on directory-based workflow

## Impact

This fix ensures that future commits will be properly validated by the pre-commit hooks, preventing issues like PR 92 where workflow requirements were bypassed. Contributors will now receive immediate feedback when they attempt to edit legacy files directly.

## Prevention

The fixed hook configuration means:
- No commits can bypass the workflow requirements
- Clear error messages guide contributors to the correct process
- The repository maintains its directory-based approach to prevent merge conflicts
