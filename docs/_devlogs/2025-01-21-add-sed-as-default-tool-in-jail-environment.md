- **High-Level Request:**

  - Add `sed` as a default tool in the jail environment so it's available for
    text processing tasks.

- **Actions Taken:**

  - **Environment Analysis:** Explored the jail setup in `jail/run.sh` and
    identified where tools are installed via Nix (line 25)
  - **Tool Addition:** Added `sed` to the nixpkgs installation list in
    `jail/run.sh`
  - **Test Creation:** Added a gauntlet test task `check-sed-available` to
    verify sed is properly installed and accessible
  - **Validation:** Ran existing tests to ensure no regressions were introduced

- **Friction/Success Points:**

  - **Success:** Simple change - just added `sed` to the existing package list,
    demonstrating good separation of concerns in the jail setup
  - **Success:** Easy to test with the existing gauntlet framework
  - **Friction:** Cannot fully test without Docker/Colima environment setup, but
    gauntlet framework provides the testing infrastructure

- **Lessons Learned:**
  - The jail environment design makes it very easy to add new tools by simply
    extending the Nix package list
  - The gauntlet framework provides excellent infrastructure for testing tool
    availability
