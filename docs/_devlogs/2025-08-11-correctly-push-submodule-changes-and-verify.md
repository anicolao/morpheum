- **Actions Taken:**
  - After being prompted, I discovered that my previous method for verifying the
    submodule push (`git push --recurse-submodules=check`) was insufficient.
  - I `cd`-ed into the `src/gemini-cli` directory and used `git status` to
    confirm that the submodule's `main` branch was ahead of its remote.
  - I then ran `git push` from within the submodule directory to push the
    changes.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - The user's guidance was essential in identifying the flawed verification
    process.
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - The most reliable way to verify the status of a submodule is to check it
    directly from within its own directory (`cd submodule && git status`). Do
    not rely solely on commands run from the parent repository.
