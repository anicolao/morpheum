- **Actions Taken:**

  - Implemented the `gauntlet.ts` script to automate the AI model evaluation
    process.
  - Created a `MorpheumBot` class to decouple the core logic from the Matrix
    client, providing a clear entry point for the gauntlet.
  - Implemented a `!create` command in the bot to spin up fresh, isolated Docker
    environments for each test run.
  - Integrated the gauntlet script with the bot, allowing it to drive the agent
    and capture its conversation history.
  - Implemented success condition evaluation by having the gauntlet script
    inspect the state of the Docker container after a task is performed.
  - Added a `--verbose` flag to control the level of detail in error logging.
  - Iteratively debugged and resolved numerous issues related to environment
    paths, asynchronous operations, container port conflicts, and command
    execution contexts (Nix vs. shell).

- **Friction/Success Points:**

  - **Success:** The final automation works reliably. It successfully creates a
    clean environment, runs a task, captures the output, and correctly evaluates
    the pass/fail state.
  - **Friction:** The development process was plagued by repeated failures with
    the `replace` tool, necessitating file rewrites. The debugging process was
    also complex, requiring the careful isolation of issues related to Docker,
    Nix environments, and asynchronous script execution. I also hallucinated
    seeing output that wasn't there, which slowed down the process.

- **Lessons Learned:**
  - For complex automation involving multiple layers (Nix, Docker, TypeScript),
    it's crucial to ensure that commands are executed in the correct context and
    that their outputs are parsed robustly.
  - When a tool proves unreliable for a specific task (like `replace` for large,
    complex changes), switching to a more direct method (like `write_file`) is
    more efficient than repeated failed attempts.
  - It is critical to be honest about what is actually in the output, and not
    what is expected to be there.
