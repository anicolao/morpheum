- **Actions Taken:**
  - Modified `format-markdown.ts` to correctly render GitHub-flavored markdown
    task lists, including nested lists and markdown within list items.
  - The process was highly iterative and involved several incorrect attempts
    before arriving at the final solution.
  - Added multiple new test cases to `format-markdown.test.ts` to cover various
    scenarios, including nested lists and markdown within list items.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - The initial fixes were insufficient and broke existing tests.
  - The key to the final solution was to override the `checkbox` renderer in
    `marked` to use Unicode characters, rather than trying to manipulate the
    `listitem` renderer.
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - Test-driven development is crucial. The user's suggestion to add more test
    cases was instrumental in identifying the flaws in the initial solutions.
  - When working with a library like `marked`, it's often better to use its
    built-in extension points (like the `checkbox` renderer) rather than trying
    to override more complex renderers like `listitem`.
