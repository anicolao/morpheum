- **High-Level Request:**
  
  - The status messages with markdown links for progress on copilot tasks are being sent as raw text instead of markdown. please fix

- **Actions Taken:**

  - **Root Cause Analysis:** Identified that the issue was in the Copilot streaming callback in `bot.ts` where chunks containing markdown links (like `[#123](https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123)`) were being sent as plain text instead of formatted HTML
  - **Code Investigation:** Found that the bot already had a `formatMarkdown()` function and `sendMarkdownMessage()` helper, but the Copilot streaming callback wasn't using them for chunks with markdown links
  - **Helper Function Creation:** Added `hasMarkdownLinks()` function to detect when text chunks contain markdown links using regex pattern `/\[.+?\]\(https?:\/\/.+?\)/`
  - **Streaming Logic Fix:** Modified the Copilot streaming callback to:
    - Check each chunk for markdown links using the helper function
    - Send chunks with markdown as HTML using the existing `sendMarkdownMessage()` helper
    - Send plain text chunks as regular messages (preserving existing behavior)
  - **Comprehensive Testing:** Created test suite in `bot-markdown-streaming.test.ts` to verify:
    - Markdown link detection works correctly on typical Copilot status messages
    - HTML formatting preserves emojis and converts markdown to proper HTML
    - The streaming logic correctly routes chunks to HTML vs. plain text based on content
  - **Targeted Implementation:** The fix only affects Copilot streaming where status messages contain GitHub issue/PR links, preserving existing behavior for OpenAI/Ollama streaming

- **Friction/Success Points:**

  - **Success:** The existing `formatMarkdown()` function and message queue HTML support made the implementation straightforward
  - **Success:** All existing tests continued to pass (106/106), confirming the change was surgical and didn't break existing functionality
  - **Success:** The fix was highly targeted - only affecting Copilot status messages that actually contain markdown links
  - **Learning:** The codebase already had all the necessary infrastructure (markdown formatting, HTML message support), it just needed to be connected properly for the Copilot streaming use case
  - **Success:** Created comprehensive tests that verify both the detection logic and the end-to-end streaming behavior
