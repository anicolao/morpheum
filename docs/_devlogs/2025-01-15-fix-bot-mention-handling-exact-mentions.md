- **High-Level Request:**
  
  - Fix the bot to only respond to explicit mentions of the exact name of the bot, rather than similar names or partial matches.

- **Actions Taken:**

  - **Problem Analysis:** Identified the root cause in `src/morpheum-bot/index.ts` lines 337-348:
    - Bot was using `body.toLowerCase().startsWith(name)` which responds to any message starting with bot name
    - This caused responses to partial matches like "morph" when bot name is "morpheus"
    - No delimiter requirement after bot name meant "morpheusbot123" would trigger response
    - Issue was affecting user experience with unwanted bot responses

  - **Implementation of Exact Mention Logic:** Replaced partial matching with exact matching:
    - Changed logic to require exact name match followed by delimiter (space, colon, comma, tab, newline) or end of string
    - Added check for `lowerBody === name` for bare mentions
    - Enhanced task extraction to handle both `:` and `,` delimiters properly
    - Added helpful behavior: bare mentions (just bot name) now show help

  - **Comprehensive Testing:** Created two new test suites:
    - `src/morpheum-bot/mention-handling.test.ts` - 18 tests for core mention logic
    - `src/morpheum-bot/bot-mention-integration.test.ts` - 13 tests for integration behavior
    - Tests cover exact matches, partial rejection, case sensitivity, edge cases
    - Manual verification script confirmed correct behavior

- **Friction/Success Points:**

  - **Success:** All 317 existing tests still pass - no regressions introduced
  - **Success:** Clear separation between mention detection and command handling (`!` commands unchanged)
  - **Success:** Comprehensive test coverage ensures behavior is well-defined
  - **Learning:** The key was defining exact delimiters rather than just preventing partial matches
  - **Learning:** Adding helpful behavior for bare mentions improves user experience

- **Technical Implementation:**

  - **Before:** `if (body.toLowerCase().startsWith(name))` - too permissive
  - **After:** Exact matching with multiple delimiter checks
  - **Backward Compatibility:** All existing commands starting with `!` work exactly as before
  - **New Behavior:** Bot is much more precise about when to respond, reducing noise

**Result:** Bot now responds only to exact mentions like "morpheus help" or "morpheus: task" but not to "morph help" or "morpheusbot123". This eliminates unwanted responses while maintaining full functionality for legitimate mentions and commands.
