- **Actions Taken:**
  - Added a new task to `TASKS.md` to investigate an incorrect commit where
    `AGENTS.md` was checked in by mistake and a change to the bot's source code
    was missed.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - The pre-commit hook correctly prevented a commit without updating the
    devlog.
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - The pre-commit hook is working as expected.
