- **High-Level Request:**
  
  - Ensure that there are no dead links in the new documentation site - at a minimum, every link should lead to a "Work in progress/Under construction" area.

- **Actions Taken:**

  - **Site Analysis:** Thoroughly analyzed the Jekyll documentation site structure in `/docs/` directory, examining all markdown files, navigation configuration, and link patterns
  - **Dead Link Identification:** Found one primary dead link - the API Reference page was referenced in `/docs/documentation/index.md` but the actual page `/docs/documentation/api.md` did not exist
  - **API Reference Creation:** Created a comprehensive "Under Construction" page at `/docs/documentation/api.md` with:
    - Clear indication that API docs are being developed
    - Detailed description of what content will be included when complete
    - Alternative resources for immediate developer needs (architecture, agent guidelines, contributing guide)
    - Community support channels for getting help
    - Proper Jekyll front matter with correct permalink (`/documentation/api/`)
  - **Link Validation:** Developed and ran validation scripts to systematically check all internal links, verifying that Jekyll's permalink structure correctly routes all page-to-page navigation
  - **Structure Verification:** Confirmed all navigation links in `_config.yml` point to valid pages, all documentation cross-references work correctly, and all external links point to valid GitHub repository URLs

- **Friction/Success Points:**

  - **Success:** Jekyll's permalink system made the fix straightforward - once the missing `api.md` file was created with the correct permalink, all existing links automatically resolved properly
  - **Success:** The documentation site structure was already well-designed with consistent patterns, making it easy to create a matching "Under Construction" page
  - **Learning:** Understanding Jekyll's routing vs. file structure is crucial - the site serves pages based on permalink definitions rather than actual file paths, so link validation needs to account for this
  - **Success:** Created reusable validation scripts that can be used for future site maintenance to catch dead links early
