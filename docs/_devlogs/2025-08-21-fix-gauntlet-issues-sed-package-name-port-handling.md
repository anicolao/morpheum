- **High-Level Request:**
  
  - Fix three critical issues with the gauntlet: `sed` is not the correct nixpkgs package name, after the first turn the bot attempts to connect to port 10001 instead of the actual random port, and the chatbot gauntlet integration only prints info without actually executing.

- **Actions Taken:**

  - **Package Name Fix:** Changed `sed` to `gnused` in `jail/run.sh` line 25 - `gnused` is the correct nixpkgs package that contains the sed tool
  - **Port Persistence Fix:** 
    - Added `currentJailClient` getter to `SWEAgent` class to access the current jail connection
    - Modified LLM provider switching to preserve the current jail client instead of creating new one with default port 10001
    - Modified command execution to use existing jail client instead of creating new one with hardcoded port
  - **Gauntlet Execution Fix:**
    - Added `executeGauntlet` export function to `gauntlet.ts` for bot integration 
    - Added `gauntletTasks` export to expose task list
    - Completely rewrote `runGauntletEvaluation` in bot to actually call gauntlet execution logic instead of just showing informational text
    - Bot now imports and executes real gauntlet functions and displays actual results with pass/fail status and success rate

- **Friction/Success Points:**

  - **Success:** The port issue was cleanly solved by preserving jail client instances instead of recreating them with defaults
  - **Success:** All existing tests continue to pass after the changes, indicating good backward compatibility
  - **Learning:** The gauntlet integration required exporting the internal functions from gauntlet.ts to make them accessible to the bot
  - **Success:** The fix is surgical and minimal - only changes what's needed to address the specific issues
  - **Success:** The bot now provides real gauntlet execution with meaningful results rather than placeholder text
