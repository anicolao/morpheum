## Actions Taken

- **Created Git URL Parser**: Implemented comprehensive parser supporting SSH (`git@github.com:user/repo`), HTTPS (`https://github.com/user/repo`), and short (`user/repo`) formats with validation
- **Built Project Room Manager**: Created service class for Matrix room creation, user invitation, and configuration management using matrix-bot-sdk
- **Integrated Bot Commands**: Added `!project create` and `!project help` commands to existing bot command structure
- **Added Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for invalid URLs, room creation failures, and invitation issues
- **Updated Help System**: Extended main help command to include project room functionality
- **Room State Storage**: Implemented persistent configuration storage using Matrix room state events (`dev.morpheum.project_config`)
- **Complete Test Coverage**: Created unit tests for all new modules (30 tests passing)

## Friction/Success Points

### Success Points
- **Clean Architecture**: New functionality integrates seamlessly with existing bot structure
- **Matrix SDK Integration**: matrix-bot-sdk provides all necessary room management capabilities
- **Comprehensive Testing**: All new code has complete test coverage with mocking
- **Error UX**: User-friendly error messages guide users through common issues
- **Room Configuration**: Custom state events provide persistent project-to-repository mapping

### Technical Challenges
- **Bot-Client Integration**: Required modifying bot constructor to accept MatrixClient for room operations
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Had to handle strict optional types in room configuration
- **Command Routing**: Updated processMessage signature to pass roomId for project room operations

## Technical Learnings

### Matrix SDK Capabilities
- `MatrixClient.createRoom()` supports initial state events for configuration
- Room aliases with timestamps prevent naming conflicts
- Private rooms with history visibility provide secure project spaces
- State events persist across bot restarts and are accessible to room members

### Git URL Parsing
- Need to handle multiple GitHub URL formats consistently
- Short format validation prevents false positives from SSH-style URLs
- regex patterns must be specific to avoid matching non-GitHub URLs

### Bot Architecture Patterns
- Command handlers follow consistent pattern for error handling and user feedback
- Matrix client injection allows for token refresh scenarios
- Per-room configuration storage enables context-aware functionality

## Next Steps for Phase II

1. **Per-Room Copilot Integration**: Configure Copilot client instances for each project room
2. **Room State Management**: Implement room configuration retrieval and updates
3. **Security Features**: Add rate limiting and access controls
4. **Enhanced UX**: Better error messages and help text
