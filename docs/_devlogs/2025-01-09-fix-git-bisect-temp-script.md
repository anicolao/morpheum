## Actions Taken

Fixed the git bisect implementation in `find-check-hash.sh` to properly handle cases where the script doesn't exist in older commits. The issue was that `git bisect run` would fail with exit code 127 when trying to execute the script in commits where it doesn't exist.

### Key Changes:
- Created a temporary test script in `/tmp` that persists across git checkouts
- Added proper cleanup with trap to remove temporary files
- Maintained proper git bisect usage throughout instead of falling back to manual loops

### Technical Solution:
```bash
# Create a temporary test script that persists across git checkouts
TEMP_TEST_SCRIPT="/tmp/check-test-$$.sh"
cat > "$TEMP_TEST_SCRIPT" << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
# Script content that handles missing check.sh gracefully
EOF
chmod +x "$TEMP_TEST_SCRIPT"

# Use the temporary script with git bisect
git bisect run "$TEMP_TEST_SCRIPT"
```

## Friction/Success Points

**Success**: The temporary script approach allows git bisect to work properly across the entire commit history, even when the script being tested doesn't exist in older commits.

**Learning**: When using `git bisect run` with a script that may not exist in all commits, create a temporary script outside the git working directory to ensure it persists across checkouts.

## Technical Learnings

- `git bisect run` executes commands in the context of each checked-out commit
- Scripts that don't exist in older commits will cause `git bisect run` to fail with exit code 127
- Using `/tmp` with process ID ($$) ensures unique temporary file names
- Proper cleanup with `trap` ensures temporary files are removed even if the script exits unexpectedly
