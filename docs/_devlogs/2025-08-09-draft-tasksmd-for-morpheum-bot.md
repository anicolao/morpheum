- **Actions Taken:**
  - Collaborated on creating and refining the initial [`TASKS.md`](TASKS.md) to
    outline the development of the Morpheum Bot. The process involved reviewing
    all project markdown to align with the project's goals, and iteratively
    refining the task list based on feedback to use a local `src/morpheum-bot`
    directory with top-level dependencies.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - This exercise served as a successful test of the human-agent collaboration
    workflow.
  - A minor friction point was an initial hang when reading multiple files,
    which was resolved by globbing for the files first.
