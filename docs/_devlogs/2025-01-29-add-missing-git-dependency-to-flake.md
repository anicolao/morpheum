## High-Level Request

Fixed bug #128 where the main flake.nix file was missing a `git` dependency, causing issues for developers using the Nix development environment with git hooks.

## Actions Taken

- **Problem Analysis**: Identified that the pre-commit hook (.husky/pre-commit) uses several git commands:
  - `git diff --name-only` (check unstaged changes)
  - `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard` (check untracked files)
  - `git diff --cached --name-only` (check staged files)
- **Root Cause**: The main flake.nix file contained packages [bun, claude-code, ollama] but was missing git
- **Solution**: Added `git` to the packages list in alphabetical order: [bun, claude-code, git, ollama]
- **Verification**: Confirmed all tests continue to pass and syntax is valid

## Friction/Success Points

- **Success**: Clear issue identification - git commands are explicitly used in pre-commit hooks
- **Success**: Minimal surgical change - only added one package to the existing list
- **Success**: Maintained alphabetical ordering of packages
- **Success**: All existing tests continue to pass after the change
- **Learning**: The jail/flake.nix is for host machine tools while main flake.nix is for development environment

## Technical Learnings

- **Nix Package Management**: flake.nix files define development environments with specific tool dependencies
- **Git Hook Dependencies**: Pre-commit hooks require git binary to be available in the development shell
- **Project Structure**: Two separate flake.nix files serve different purposes:
  - `flake.nix` - main development environment tools
  - `jail/flake.nix` - host machine infrastructure tools (docker, colima, etc.)
- **Alphabetical Ordering**: Package lists should maintain alphabetical order for consistency
