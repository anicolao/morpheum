## High-Level Request

Fixed two specific issues with the `refine-existing-codebase` gauntlet task:
1. The `sed` package name should be `gnused` in flake.nix 
2. The output parsing should use `cleanStdoutForJSON` to remove flake.nix shellHook pollution

## Actions Taken

- **Package Name Fix**: Changed `sed` to `gnused` in the flake.nix packages list (line 347 in gauntlet.ts)
  - `gnused` is the correct nixpkgs package name for the sed tool
  - This aligns with previous fixes done for `jail/run.sh` 

- **Stdout Cleaning Fix**: Modified the successCondition to use `cleanStdoutForJSON()` before JSON parsing (line 434)
  - Added: `const cleanStdout = cleanStdoutForJSON(stdout);`
  - Changed: `JSON.parse(cleanStdout)` instead of `JSON.parse(stdout)`
  - This removes flake.nix shellHook messages like "âœ… Gauntlet project environment ready"

- **Comprehensive Testing**: Added 2 focused tests in gauntlet.test.ts:
  - Test API response parsing with single-line flake.nix pollution
  - Test API response parsing with multi-line flake.nix pollution
  - Both tests validate that pollution is removed and JSON parses correctly

- **Validation**: Ran full test suite to ensure no regressions
  - All 194 tests pass (increased from 192 with the new tests)

## Friction/Success Points

- **Success**: Issue was clearly documented with specific line numbers and problems
- **Success**: Existing `cleanStdoutForJSON` utility function made the fix straightforward
- **Success**: Comprehensive test coverage already existed for similar scenarios
- **Success**: Minimal surgical changes - only modified 2 lines of core logic
- **Learning**: The refine-existing-codebase task creates its own flake.nix with shellHook output that can pollute curl responses

## Technical Learnings

- **Package Names**: `sed` vs `gnused` - the nixpkgs ecosystem uses `gnused` for the GNU sed implementation
- **Stdout Pollution**: Any gauntlet task that uses `nix develop` can have stdout polluted by shellHook messages
- **Reusable Patterns**: The `cleanStdoutForJSON` function is designed exactly for this type of pollution filtering
- **Test Strategy**: Testing pollution scenarios helps catch real-world issues that pure unit tests might miss
