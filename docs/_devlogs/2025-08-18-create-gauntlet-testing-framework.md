- **Actions Taken:**

  - Generated a new testing framework called "The Gauntlet" to evaluate
    different models for suitability as Morpheum's coding agent choice.
  - Created `GAUNTLET.md` to document the framework.
  - Added a TODO item in `TASKS.md` to reflect this task.
  - Updated this `DEVLOG.md` to record the work.
  - Ensured all actions followed the rules in `AGENTS.md`.

- **Friction/Success Points:**

  - The process of generating the framework and updating the project markdown
    was smooth and followed the established workflow.

- **Lessons Learned:**
  - Having a clear set of guidelines in `AGENTS.md` and a consistent format for
    `DEVLOG.md` and `TASKS.md` makes it easy to integrate new work into the
    project.
