- **Actions Taken:**
  - Created the first draft of the [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) file, focusing on
    the near-term tasks required to move to a Matrix-based workflow. The draft
    was reviewed and updated to include the concept of forking the Gemini CLI
    for the initial bot, the idea of each AI agent having its own GitHub
    account, and to ensure consistency regarding the use of
    TypeScript/JavaScript for the bot development.
