## Actions Taken

### Design Document Creation
- Created comprehensive `PROJECT_ROOMS.md` design document (454 lines) covering the new project rooms feature
- Analyzed existing Morpheum architecture including Matrix bot SDK integration and GitHub Copilot capabilities
- Reviewed command structure patterns from `src/morpheum-bot/bot.ts` to understand implementation requirements

### Jekyll Site Integration
- Created `/docs/proposals/project-rooms.md` Jekyll page for public visibility following AGENTS.md guidelines
- Updated `/docs/proposals/index.md` to include the new proposal in both Active Proposals and Implementation Status sections
- Followed established pattern of linking to both Jekyll page and GitHub document

### Architecture Analysis
- Studied Matrix bot SDK capabilities (v0.7.1) for room creation and management
- Examined existing GitHub Copilot integration patterns in `copilotClient.ts`
- Analyzed command handler structure to understand integration points for `!project create`

## Friction/Success Points

### Success Points
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: The design document thoroughly covers all aspects from user interface to security considerations
- **Architecture Alignment**: Solution leverages existing Matrix and GitHub Copilot infrastructure without requiring major changes
- **User Experience Focus**: Clear command interface (`!project create git@github.com:user/repo`) with multiple URL format support
- **Security Considerations**: Proper rate limiting, room privacy, and permission management included in design

### Implementation Insights
- Matrix bot SDK already provides necessary capabilities for room creation via `createRoom()` method
- Existing GitHub Copilot integration can be extended for per-room configuration
- Room state events provide persistent storage for project-to-repository mapping
- Command handler pattern in `bot.ts` makes integration straightforward

## Technical Learnings

### Matrix SDK Capabilities Discovery
- `matrix-bot-sdk` v0.7.1 supports room creation with custom state events
- `AutojoinRoomsMixin` already handles invitation acceptance patterns
- Room-specific bot configuration can be managed through Matrix room state or local storage

### GitHub Integration Patterns
- Existing `CopilotClient` can be instantiated per-room for repository-specific contexts
- Git URL parsing needs to support SSH (`git@github.com:user/repo`) and HTTPS formats
- Repository access validation should be performed during room creation

### Design Document Structure
- Following established patterns from `COPILOT_PROPOSAL.md` ensures consistency
- Including implementation phases, success metrics, and security considerations provides complete planning
- Jekyll integration for public visibility aligns with project documentation strategy

### Architecture Integration Points
- New `handleProjectCommand()` method needed in `MorpheumBot` class
- Git URL parser utility for extracting owner/repo from various formats
- Room configuration manager for persistent project-to-repository mapping
- Enhanced help system to include project room commands

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Git URL Parser Implementation** - Support SSH, HTTPS, and short formats
2. **Room Creation Service** - Matrix room creation with proper configuration
3. **User Invitation Management** - Handle invitations and permission assignment
4. **Bot Configuration per Room** - Per-room LLM client instances
5. **Command Handler Integration** - Add `!project create` to existing command structure
6. **Security Implementation** - Rate limiting and access controls
7. **Testing and Validation** - Comprehensive test coverage for all scenarios

The design provides a solid foundation for implementation while maintaining consistency with Morpheum's existing architecture and user experience patterns.
