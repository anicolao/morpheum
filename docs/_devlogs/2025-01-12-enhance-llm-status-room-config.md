## Actions Taken

Enhanced the `!llm status` command to display room-specific configuration when the bot is operating in project rooms:

- Modified `handleInfoCommand` to accept `roomId` parameter
- Updated `handleLLMCommand` to receive and use `roomId` for configuration lookups
- Enhanced `!llm status` implementation to show both global and room-specific configurations
- Added comprehensive markdown formatting for better readability
- Updated all related tests to match new output format

## Technical Implementation

The enhancement works by:
1. Passing `roomId` from `processMessage` through `handleInfoCommand` to `handleLLMCommand`
2. In the status command, checking if the room has project configuration stored in Matrix room state
3. Displaying global configuration first, then project room configuration if available
4. Using `sendMarkdownMessage` for proper formatting with bold headers and structured output

## Friction/Success Points

**Success:**
- Clear separation of global vs room-specific configuration display
- Comprehensive test coverage ensuring functionality works correctly
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing functionality

**Minor friction:**
- Had to update multiple test files to accommodate new message format (markdown + HTML)
- Pre-commit hooks require devlog and task entries, ensuring proper documentation

## Technical Learnings

- Room configuration lookup is cached for performance, avoiding repeated Matrix API calls
- The bot maintains separation between global configuration and temporary room-specific configurations
- Proper error handling ensures graceful fallback when room configuration is unavailable
- Test strategy: mock Matrix client to simulate different room scenarios (project vs regular rooms)

This enhancement provides users with full visibility into both global and room-specific bot configurations, addressing the feedback about configuration transparency in project rooms.
