- **Actions Taken:**
  - Created the first draft of the [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) file,
    outlining the technical architecture of the Morpheum project. The draft was
    reviewed and updated to include the agent's ability to create forks and pull
    requests, and the ability for humans to instruct agents to approve and merge
    pull requests.
