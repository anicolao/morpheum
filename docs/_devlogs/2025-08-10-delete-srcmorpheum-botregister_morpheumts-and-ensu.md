- **Actions Taken:**
  - Deleted `src/morpheum-bot/register_morpheum.ts`.
  - Attempted to update `.gitignore` to correctly ignore `.secrets` and remove
    the `register_morpheum.ts` entry.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - Repeatedly struggled with correctly appending/modifying `.gitignore` using
    `write_file`, leading to overwrites and incorrect entries.
  - Discovered that `src/morpheum-bot/register_morpheum.ts` was never tracked by
    Git, so `git rm` was not applicable.
  - Successfully used `echo >>` to append `.secrets` to `.gitignore` after
    multiple attempts.
  - Learned the importance of verifying `git status` and file content after
    every modification, especially for `.gitignore`.
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - My current implementation of file modification (especially appending) is
    prone to errors and needs significant improvement.
  - For simple appends, `echo >>` is a more reliable shell command than
    `write_file` (given my current limitations).
  - Thoroughly check `git status` and file content after every step to catch
    errors early.
