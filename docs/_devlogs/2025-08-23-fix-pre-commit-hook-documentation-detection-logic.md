## Actions Taken

### Problem Identification
- Discovered that the pre-commit hook was incorrectly treating README.md as a documentation-only file
- Found that the regex pattern `(README\.md|docs/|\.md$|\.txt$|\.yml$|\.yaml$|package\.json|package-lock\.json|\.gitignore)` was too broad
- README.md changes should require devlog and task entries since it's a core project file

### Logic Fix
- Updated the documentation detection regex to only include files that truly don't need devlog/task entries
- New pattern: `(^docs/|\.yml$|\.yaml$|package\.json|package-lock\.json|\.gitignore)`
- Removed README.md and generic .md/.txt patterns from the exemption list
- Added clear comment explaining that README.md is NOT considered documentation-only

### Testing
- Verified that README.md changes now correctly trigger the devlog/task requirement
- Confirmed that files in docs/ directory are still correctly exempted
- Fixed minor formatting issue with echo -e command

## Friction/Success Points

### Success Points
- Successfully identified and fixed the logical flaw in documentation detection
- Maintained proper exemptions for truly documentation-only files
- Enhanced error messaging clarity

### Friction Points
- Initially missed that the changes weren't staged, leading to confusion during testing
- Had to debug step-by-step to understand why the logic wasn't working as expected

## Technical Learnings

### Shell Script Debugging
- Learned effective techniques for debugging bash scripts by testing individual components
- Practiced using git diff and staging to manage changes during development
- Understanding of shell pattern matching and regex behavior in grep

### Pre-commit Hook Development
- Gained experience in designing robust file detection logic
- Learned importance of testing edge cases in git hooks
- Understanding of when to be strict vs. permissive in workflow enforcement

## Next Steps

- Complete the task entry for this fix
- Test the corrected logic to ensure it works as expected
- Commit the changes and verify the hook correctly enforces requirements
