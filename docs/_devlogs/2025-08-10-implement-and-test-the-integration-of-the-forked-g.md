- **Actions Taken:**
  - Implemented an initial stub to call the `gemini-cli` (as a Git submodule)
    from the `morpheum-bot`.
  - After being prompted, created a test for the stub implementation.
  - Conducted integration testing at the user's request, which revealed an
    infinite loop in the bot's interaction with the CLI.
  - Fixed the infinite loop bug.
  - Committed the working stub, test, and bugfix to both the main repository and
    the submodule.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - The initial implementation was incomplete and required user intervention to
    add necessary testing. This highlights a flaw in my process.
  - Integration testing was crucial for identifying a critical bug (the infinite
    loop) that was not caught by the initial unit test.
  - Successfully fixed the bug and got the integration working at a basic level.
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - I must be more proactive about including testing as part of the development
    process, rather than waiting for a prompt. A test-driven approach would have
    been more effective.
  - It is critical to update [`DEVLOG.md`](DEVLOG.md) and [`TASKS.md`](TASKS.md)
    immediately after completing work, especially when the work involves
    multiple steps, interruptions, and bug fixes. Failing to do so loses
    important context about the development process.
