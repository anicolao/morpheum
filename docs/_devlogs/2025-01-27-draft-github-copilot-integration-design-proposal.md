- **High-Level Request:**

  - Draft a comprehensive design proposal for integrating GitHub Copilot as a
    third LLM provider in the Morpheum bot, enabling users to switch to
    "copilot" mode for issue resolution with real-time status updates.

- **Actions Taken:**

  - **Architecture Analysis:**
    - Explored the existing codebase to understand current LLM integration
      patterns (OpenAI/Ollama)
    - Analyzed the bot's command structure, factory patterns, and Matrix
      integration
    - Reviewed existing documentation (README.md, VISION.md, ROADMAP.md) for
      context
  - **Design Proposal Creation:**
    - Created comprehensive `COPILOT_PROPOSAL.md` with detailed technical
      specifications
    - Designed CopilotClient class following existing LLMClient interface
      patterns
    - Planned GitHub authentication and session management architecture
    - Specified real-time status update mechanisms using polling and streaming
    - Outlined complete workflow from issue creation to PR completion
  - **Implementation Planning:**
    - Documented all required file changes (new files and modifications)
    - Planned comprehensive testing strategy (unit, integration, manual)
    - Created phased rollout approach for safe deployment
    - Specified environment configuration and security considerations

- **Friction/Success Points:**

  - **Success:** The existing LLMClient interface and factory pattern provided
    excellent extensibility points for adding GitHub Copilot
  - **Success:** The bot's command structure was well-designed for adding new
    provider-specific commands
  - **Success:** Clear separation of concerns in the current architecture made
    integration planning straightforward
  - **Success:** Comprehensive understanding of Matrix chat integration enabled
    design of seamless status update mechanisms
  - **Friction:** Pre-commit hooks required updating DEVLOG.md and TASKS.md,
    enforcing good documentation practices

- **Lessons Learned:**
  - **Interface Design:** Well-designed interfaces (like LLMClient) make
    extending functionality much easier
  - **Factory Patterns:** The existing createLLMClient factory pattern provides
    a clean extension point for new providers
  - **Documentation First:** Creating comprehensive design documents before
    implementation helps identify potential issues and requirements
  - **Status Updates:** Real-time progress feedback is crucial for long-running
    AI operations like issue resolution
  - **Workflow Integration:** New features should integrate seamlessly with
    existing user workflows rather than requiring learning new paradigms
