- **Actions Taken:**
  - Manually pushed the `src/gemini-cli` submodule from within its directory to
    ensure it was up-to-date with its remote.
  - Updated the `.husky/pre-commit` hook to include a check that verifies the
    `src/gemini-cli` submodule is pushed to its remote before allowing a commit.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - The previous commit failed because the submodule was not correctly pushed,
    despite the parent repository being up-to-date.
  - The pre-commit hook now provides a robust check for submodule status.
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - Always verify submodule status directly from within the submodule directory.
  - Pre-commit hooks are valuable for enforcing development practices and
    preventing common mistakes.
