- **Actions Taken:**
  - Created a custom `markdown-it` plugin to render Unicode checkboxes.
  - Removed the `markdown-it-task-checkbox` dependency.
  - Updated the tests to reflect the new plugin's output.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - The `markdown-it-task-checkbox` plugin was not flexible enough to allow for
    the desired output.
  - By creating a custom plugin, I was able to get complete control over the
    rendering of task list items.
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - When a library is not meeting your needs, it's often better to write your
    own solution than to try to force it to work.
