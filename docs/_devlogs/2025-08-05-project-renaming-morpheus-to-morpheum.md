- **Actions Taken:**
  - Corrected a widespread typo, renaming all instances of "Morpheus" to
    "Morpheum" across [`README.md`](README.md) and [`DEVLOG.md`](DEVLOG.md).
    This involved multiple `replace` operations. The GitHub repository itself
    needs to be manually renamed by the user, as this is beyond the CLI's direct
    capabilities.
