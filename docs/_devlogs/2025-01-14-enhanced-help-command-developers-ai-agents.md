## Actions Taken

- Analyzed issue #130 requesting help functionality for `_dev_ola`
- Enhanced the `!help` command in MorpheumBot to include developer and AI agent guidance
- Added comprehensive information about project structure, development processes, and agent guidelines
- Updated the help message with structured sections for different user types
- Fixed related tests to accommodate the new message format

## Technical Changes

### Enhanced Help Command
- Modified `src/morpheum-bot/bot.ts` to include new developer-focused sections in help output
- Changed from `sendMessage()` to `sendMarkdownMessage()` for better formatting
- Added sections: "Matrix Bot Commands", "For Developers & AI Agents", "Important Notes for Agents"

### Test Updates
- Updated test expectations in `bot.test.ts`, `bot-project-commands.test.ts`, and `bot-copilot.test.ts`
- Fixed assertions to account for markdown message format (text + HTML parameters)

### Content Added
- Information about directory-based task and devlog management
- References to key documentation files (AGENTS.md, README.md, etc.)
- Preferred tooling guidelines (bun over npm)
- GitHub Pages documentation links
- Critical restrictions for AI agents (don't edit TASKS.md/DEVLOG.md directly)

## Friction/Success Points

### Success
- ✅ All tests pass after the enhancement
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained for existing functionality
- ✅ Comprehensive information now available for developers and AI agents
- ✅ Well-structured, organized help content

### Learning Points
- The project uses a pre-commit hook requiring devlog and task entries for every commit
- This directory-based system prevents merge conflicts on centralized files
- The help system was missing crucial information for project contributors
- Using markdown formatting significantly improves help message presentation

## Technical Learnings

1. **Directory-Based Documentation**: Understanding the new workflow where individual files are created in `docs/_tasks/` and `docs/_devlogs/` instead of editing centralized files
2. **Markdown Message Handling**: The bot has sophisticated markdown rendering with `sendMarkdownMessage()` that provides both text and HTML versions
3. **Test Parameter Updates**: When changing from single-parameter to dual-parameter message calls, all related tests need updating with `expect.any(String)` for the second parameter
4. **Pre-commit Workflow**: Every change requires proper documentation through the task and devlog system

The enhancement successfully addresses the original issue by providing comprehensive help for developers and AI agents working on Morpheum.
