- **Actions Taken:**
  - Implemented a message queue and throttling system in
    `src/morpheum-bot/index.ts` to prevent rate-limiting errors from the Matrix
    server.
  - Refactored the message queue logic into its own module,
    `src/morpheum-bot/message-queue.ts`.
  - Wrote unit tests for the message queue, including the rate-limiting and
    retry logic.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - The previous rate-limiting fix was insufficient and was causing the bot to
    crash.
  - The new message queue and throttling system is more robust and should
    prevent the bot from crashing due to rate-limiting errors.
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - It's important to test features thoroughly, especially those that handle
    errors and edge cases.
  - Refactoring code into smaller, more manageable modules makes it easier to
    test and maintain.
