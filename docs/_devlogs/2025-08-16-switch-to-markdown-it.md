- **Actions Taken:**
  - Switched from `marked` to `markdown-it` to handle markdown formatting.
  - Installed `markdown-it` and `markdown-it-task-checkbox`.
  - Updated the tests to match the output of `markdown-it`.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - The `marked` library was proving to be too difficult to customize.
  - `markdown-it` is more extensible and easier to work with.
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - When a library is not meeting your needs, it's often better to switch to a
    different one than to try to force it to work.
