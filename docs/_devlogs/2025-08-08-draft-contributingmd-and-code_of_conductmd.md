- **Actions Taken:**
  - Created the first drafts of the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) and
    [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) files. The
    [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) was heavily revised to reflect the
    Matrix-centric, AI-agent-mediated workflow.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - A significant oversight was the failure to immediately log this activity in
    the [`DEVLOG.md`](DEVLOG.md), highlighting a need for stricter adherence to
    logging conventions.
