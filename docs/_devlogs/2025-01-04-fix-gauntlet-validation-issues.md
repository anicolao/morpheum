- **Actions Taken:**

  - Fixed validation patterns in gauntlet tasks to ensure consistent use of
    `/project` directory context
  - Updated XML converter task to be more flexible - now asks agents to write a
    script instead of installing specific tools
  - Created test XML file for validating XML to JSON conversion functionality
  - Modified file-checking tasks to properly use `cd /project &&` for correct
    working directory context
  - **Replaced file content checks with actual server functionality testing:**
    - **hello-world-server task**: Instead of just checking if `server.js`
      contains "Hello, Morpheum!" text, now starts the server with `execa` in
      background using `nix develop -c bun run server.js`, waits 3 seconds for
      startup, then uses `curl -s localhost:3000` to test actual HTTP
      functionality
    - **refine-existing-codebase task**: First creates initial server.js file
      with basic Bun server code (as specified in GAUNTLET.md), then starts the
      modified server and tests the `/api/v1/status` endpoint by curling it and
      parsing the JSON response to verify structure
    - Added proper error handling with try/catch blocks and server process
      cleanup using `serverProcess.kill()`
  - Ensured all tests continue to pass after changes

- **Friction/Success Points:**

  - **Success:** The XML task validation is now much more practical - agents can
    use any approach (yq, jq, custom scripts, etc.) as long as they produce
    working XML to JSON conversion
  - **Success:** Fixed directory context issues that could cause false negatives
    when agents create files in the correct `/project` directory
  - **Success:** Server validation now tests real functionality - eliminates
    false positives where files contained expected text but servers didn't
    actually work
  - **Success:** Background server process management using `execa` without
    awaiting, combined with `setTimeout` delays and proper cleanup, provides
    reliable testing of HTTP endpoints
  - **Lesson:** Pre-commit hooks enforce documentation updates, which helps
    maintain project coherence
  - **Lesson:** Testing actual server functionality requires careful process
    management - starting servers in background, waiting for startup, making
    HTTP requests, and cleaning up processes

- **Technical Learnings:**
  - **Background Process Management**: Using `execa()` without awaiting allows
    starting servers in background, then using `serverProcess.kill()` for
    cleanup
  - **Server Startup Timing**: 3-second delay with `setTimeout` provides
    reliable server startup time before testing endpoints
  - **HTTP Testing in Containers**: `curl -s localhost:3000` works reliably
    within Docker containers for testing server responses
  - **Nested Nix Environments**: Running `nix develop -c bun run server.js`
    inside Docker containers requires proper command chaining
  - **Error Handling for Server Tests**: Try/catch blocks prevent test failures
    from crashing the validation system
  - **JSON Response Validation**: Parsing curl output with `JSON.parse()` allows
    testing response structure, not just text content
