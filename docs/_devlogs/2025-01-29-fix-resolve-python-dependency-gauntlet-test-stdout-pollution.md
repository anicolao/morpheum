- **High-Level Request:**
  
  - The resolve-python-dependency gauntlet test was failing because it expected completely empty stdout (`stdout === ""`) but flake.nix shellHook output `"✅ DOCKER_HOST automatically set to Colima's socket."` polluted the stdout.

- **Actions Taken:**

  - **Applied stdout cleaning logic:** Modified the `resolve-python-dependency` successCondition to clean flake.nix shellHook pollution using the same regex pattern already used in `cleanStdoutForJSON`:
    - Added: `const cleanStdout = stdout.replace(/^.*✅.*$/gm, '').trim();`
    - Changed comparison from `stdout === ""` to `cleanStdout === ""`
  - **Added comprehensive test coverage:** Created test cases to verify the cleaning logic works for empty stdout scenarios
  - **Validated fix:** All 143 tests pass, confirming no regressions introduced

- **Lessons Learned:**
  - Reusing existing cleaning patterns reduces complexity and maintains consistency
  - The flake.nix shellHook output can pollute stdout in any command that uses `nix develop`, so similar issues may occur in other gauntlet tests
  - Minimal surgical fixes that leverage existing code are preferable to creating new cleaning functions
