- **High-Level Request:**

  - Propose a design that uses the GitHub Pages site as the central repository/source of truth for current issues and open tasks. The design should enable: seeing a summary of all open tasks, searching open and closed tasks, easily adding tasks from chat room, and seeing task summaries in chat room (not detailed logs).

- **Actions Taken:**

  - **Current System Analysis:** Thoroughly analyzed existing task management infrastructure including directory-based structure in `docs/_tasks/`, Jekyll collections, Matrix bot integration (`task-utils.ts`), and GitHub Pages deployment
  - **Design Document Creation:** Created comprehensive `ISSUE_MANAGEMENT.md` (702 lines) covering all requirements:
    - Enhanced GitHub Pages interface with interactive dashboard, filtering, and search
    - Matrix bot command extensions (!summary, !search, !add-task, !recent)
    - Client-side JavaScript search with advanced filtering capabilities
    - JSON API endpoint for programmatic access to task data
    - Implementation roadmap with 3-phase rollout plan
  - **Technical Architecture:** Designed solutions for task statistics dashboard, search interface, and chat integration while maintaining backward compatibility
  - **Migration Strategy:** Outlined gradual rollout approach preserving existing workflows while adding new capabilities

- **Friction/Success Points:**

  - **Success:** Built upon existing strengths (directory-based tasks, Jekyll collections, Matrix bot) rather than replacing them
  - **Success:** Design addresses all requirements: task summaries, search functionality, chat integration, and centralized visibility
  - **Success:** Comprehensive technical considerations including performance, scalability, security, and maintenance
  - **Learning:** The existing infrastructure is well-designed and just needs enhanced interfaces and search capabilities
  - **Success:** Detailed implementation roadmap provides clear deliverables and timeline for execution

- **Technical Learnings:**

  - **Jekyll Collections:** The existing Jekyll collections system provides an excellent foundation for enhanced task interfaces
  - **Matrix Bot Extension:** Current `task-utils.ts` provides solid base for additional commands and functionality  
  - **Client-Side Search:** JavaScript-based filtering can handle hundreds of tasks efficiently without server load
  - **API Design:** GitHub Pages can serve JSON endpoints for programmatic access to task data
  - **GitHub Actions Integration:** Existing CI/CD can be extended for search index generation and task validation
