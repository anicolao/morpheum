- **Actions Taken:**
  - Modified the message queue to batch multiple messages into a single request,
    reducing the number of requests sent to the Matrix server.
  - Added a failing test case for message batching, then implemented the logic
    to make the test pass.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - The previous implementation of the message queue was not efficient enough
    and was still at risk of hitting rate limits.
  - The new batching system is more robust and should significantly reduce the
    number of requests sent to the server.
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - It's important to not just handle errors, but to also design systems that
    are less likely to cause them in the first place.
  - Test-driven development is a great way to ensure that new features are
    implemented correctly.
