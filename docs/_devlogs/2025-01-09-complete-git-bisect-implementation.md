- **Implementation Completion:**
  
  - Successfully completed the git bisect script implementation with working logic for finding when check.sh started failing

- **Final Implementation Details:**

  - **Fixed bisect logic:** Resolved issues with git checkout during bisect setup that were causing "good and bad commit" conflicts
  - **Small history handling:** Added special handling for repositories with few commits (≤4) to test each commit individually
  - **Robust commit testing:** Uses `git show` to check file existence without affecting bisect state
  - **Dependency management:** Automatically installs npm dependencies when testing historical commits
  - **Clean output:** Provides clear results with commit hash and details as requested

- **Testing Results:**

  - ✅ Script correctly identifies `1d33fed640e6ddc841b4625dfc2f4ee7baefc420` as the first failing commit
  - ✅ This is the commit where check.sh was introduced and immediately failed due to TypeScript errors
  - ✅ Output format matches requirements: displays the commit hash of the first failing commit
  - ✅ Script handles edge cases like missing dependencies and non-existent check.sh in historical commits

- **Success:**

  - Both check.sh and find-check-hash.sh are now complete and working correctly
  - The solution successfully identifies the regression point as requested
  - Scripts are robust and handle various git repository scenarios
