- **High-Level Request:**
  
  - The gauntlet integrated with matrix doesn't show any feedback as it is running. It should display messages to the chat room as well as to the console so that the user can follow along with what the bot is doing as it tries to navigate the gauntlet, and partial scoring should be summarized after each test, so that the user can see progress towards test suite completion. Perhaps a table with test name and score in two columns, and under score it can say "Pending" for tasks not yet started and "Next" for the next task.

- **Actions Taken:**

  - **Enhanced gauntlet execution with progress callbacks:**
    - Added `ProgressCallback` type for progress reporting function signatures
    - Modified `executeGauntlet()` to accept optional progress callback parameter
    - Updated `runGauntlet()` to report progress at key milestones throughout execution
  - **Implemented dynamic progress table functionality:**
    - Created `createProgressTable()` helper function to generate markdown tables
    - Shows task status with clear emoji indicators: ⏳ PENDING, ▶️ NEXT, ✅ PASS, ❌ FAIL
    - Updates table before and after each task execution to show real-time progress
  - **Added comprehensive real-time feedback messages:**
    - Task start notifications with description previews
    - Environment setup progress (cleanup, creation, readiness checks)
    - Task execution and evaluation status updates
    - Clear pass/fail results for individual tasks
  - **Enhanced bot integration:**
    - Modified bot's `runGauntletEvaluation()` method to pass progress callback to gauntlet execution
    - Uses `sendMarkdownMessage()` for proper formatting in Matrix chat with HTML rendering
    - Maintains existing result summary functionality while adding real-time updates
  - **Maintained backward compatibility:**
    - Progress callback parameter is optional - CLI usage remains completely unchanged
    - All existing functionality preserved, all 125 tests continue to pass
    - Added comprehensive tests for new progress functionality including callback verification

- **Friction/Success Points:**

  - **Success:** The implementation is surgical and minimal - only adds optional callback without breaking existing behavior
  - **Success:** Progress table provides clear visual status tracking that updates in real-time as tasks execute
  - **Success:** Users can now follow gauntlet progress step-by-step instead of waiting for final results
  - **Learning:** TypeScript parameter addition required updating test expectations to include the new callback parameter
  - **Success:** Integration with Matrix markdown formatting provides professional-looking progress updates
  - **Success:** All 125 tests pass including 13 gauntlet-specific tests and new progress verification tests
