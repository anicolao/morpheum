- **Actions Taken:**

  - Addressed feedback from PR #1 and PR #2 to ensure pull requests can be
    merged successfully.
  - Confirmed AGENTS.md correctly states preference for `bun` over `npm` for
    package management (no change needed).
  - Updated package.json test script to use `npx vitest` for better
    compatibility when vitest isn't globally installed.
  - Enhanced MorpheumBot class to include model information in task status
    messages, addressing PR #2 feedback to "indicate the model, too".
  - Added ollamaModel as a private property in the bot to make it accessible in
    status messages.
  - Modified handleTask method to display "Working on: [task] using [model]..."
    format.

- **Friction/Success Points:**

  - **Success:** Successfully identified and addressed specific reviewer
    feedback from multiple PRs.
  - **Friction:** Pre-commit hook correctly enforced the requirement to update
    DEVLOG.md and TASKS.md, ensuring proper logging practices.
  - **Success:** Tests run successfully after npm install, confirming
    package.json changes work correctly.

- **Lessons Learned:**
  - PR review comments provide valuable guidance for improving code quality and
    user experience.
  - The pre-commit hook is an effective enforcement mechanism for maintaining
    project documentation standards.
  - Status messages benefit from including contextual information like which
    model is being used for tasks.
