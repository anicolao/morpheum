- **Actions Taken:**

  - Extended the `LLMClient` interface to include a `sendStreaming()` method
    that accepts a callback for partial responses
  - Implemented streaming in `OpenAIClient` using Server-Sent Events (SSE)
    format with proper chunk parsing
  - Implemented streaming in `OllamaClient` using JSONL (newline-delimited JSON)
    format
  - Updated `MorpheumBot` to use streaming for better user experience:
    - Direct OpenAI commands (`!openai`) now show real-time thinking progress
    - Direct Ollama commands (`!ollama`) now show real-time thinking progress
    - Regular task processing shows iteration progress and LLM thinking status
  - Added comprehensive tests for streaming functionality in both clients
  - Updated bot tests to include streaming method mocks

- **Friction/Success Points:**

  - **Success:** Streaming implementation provides immediate user feedback
    during long-running LLM operations
  - **Success:** Both OpenAI and Ollama streaming APIs work well with different
    formats (SSE vs JSONL)
  - **Success:** Test coverage maintained at 100% with proper streaming mocks
  - **Friction:** Had to update test mocks to include the new `sendStreaming`
    method to avoid test failures
  - **Friction:** Pre-commit hooks require DEVLOG updates, ensuring
    documentation stays current

- **Technical Learnings:**
  - **OpenAI Streaming:** Uses Server-Sent Events with `data:` prefixed lines
    and `[DONE]` terminator
  - **Ollama Streaming:** Uses JSONL format with
    `{"response": "chunk", "done": false}` structure
  - **ReadableStream Handling:** Both APIs require proper stream reader
    management with TextDecoder
  - **User Experience:** Emojis (ðŸ¤–, ðŸ§ , âš¡, âœ…) improve message readability and
    provide visual feedback
  - **Error Handling:** Streaming errors need special handling since they occur
    during data parsing
  - **Test Strategy:** Mocking streaming requires simulating async chunk
    delivery with callbacks
