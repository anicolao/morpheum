- **High-Level Request:**
  
  - The help markdown for the gauntlet command isn't formatted, the raw markdown is being sent to matrix

- **Actions Taken:**

  - **Root Cause Analysis:** Identified that the gauntlet command's help and list subcommands were using `sendMessage()` which sends raw markdown to Matrix, instead of `sendMarkdownMessage()` which properly converts markdown to HTML for Matrix clients
  - **Code Investigation:** Examined how other commands like `!tasks` and `!devlog` properly use `sendMarkdownMessage()` to send both markdown and HTML content to Matrix
  - **Fix Implementation:** 
    - Changed `await sendMessage(helpMessage)` to `await sendMarkdownMessage(helpMessage, sendMessage)` in gauntlet help handler
    - Changed `await sendMessage(tasksMessage)` to `await sendMarkdownMessage(tasksMessage, sendMessage)` in gauntlet list handler
  - **Comprehensive Testing:** Added 3 new test cases to verify proper markdown formatting:
    - Test for gauntlet help command with formatted markdown and HTML output
    - Test for gauntlet list command with formatted markdown and HTML output  
    - Test for copilot provider rejection with proper environment setup
  - **Test Infrastructure Enhancement:** Updated formatMarkdown mock to handle gauntlet-specific content patterns
  - **Validation:** All 105 tests passing, confirming no regressions introduced

- **Friction/Success Points:**

  - **Success:** The fix was surgical and minimal - only changed 2 function calls from `sendMessage()` to `sendMarkdownMessage()`
  - **Success:** Existing markdown formatting infrastructure worked perfectly for gauntlet commands
  - **Learning:** Matrix clients require HTML formatting for proper display of markdown content (bold, code blocks, etc.)
  - **Success:** Test pattern was well-established - other commands like `!tasks` already verified both markdown and HTML output
  - **Success:** The `sendMarkdownMessage()` helper function provides a clean abstraction for sending formatted content
  - **Technical Detail:** Matrix clients display raw markdown text when sent with regular `sendMessage()`, but render properly formatted HTML when using `sendMarkdownMessage()`

- **Technical Learnings:**
  - **Matrix Formatting:** Matrix protocol supports both plain text and HTML messages - the `sendMarkdownMessage()` function converts markdown to HTML using the `formatMarkdown()` utility
  - **Testing Patterns:** Tests verify both raw markdown content and the formatted HTML output to ensure complete functionality
  - **Mock Strategy:** Enhanced test mocks to handle gauntlet-specific content while maintaining simplicity and reliability
