## Actions Taken

### Final Problem Discovery
- Discovered that while the logic enhancements were correct, the hooks weren't being called at all
- Found that git's `core.hooksPath` wasn't configured to point to `.husky/`
- Identified that the `.husky/_/pre-commit` file wasn't calling our custom `.husky/pre-commit` script

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue had two components:
1. **Missing Husky Initialization**: git wasn't configured to use `.husky/` as the hooks directory
2. **Broken Hook Delegation**: `.husky/_/pre-commit` contained the old deprecated wrapper that didn't call our script

### Complete Fix Applied
1. **Initialized Husky Properly**: Ran `npx husky` to set up git's `core.hooksPath` to `.husky/_`
2. **Fixed Hook Delegation**: Updated `.husky/_/pre-commit` to properly call our custom `.husky/pre-commit` script:
   ```sh
   #!/usr/bin/env sh
   .husky/pre-commit
   ```

### Verification Testing
- ✅ Confirmed that README.md changes are now properly blocked without devlog/task entries
- ✅ Verified the hook shows clear error messages with specific requirements
- ✅ Tested that commits with proper devlog/task entries are allowed to proceed

## Friction/Success Points

### Success Points
- Successfully identified the complete root cause spanning both logic and configuration
- Applied systematic debugging to isolate the Husky configuration issue
- Achieved full working pre-commit hook enforcement

### Friction Points
- Multiple layers of issues (logic, then configuration) required step-by-step debugging
- Had to understand the interaction between git hooks, Husky v9, and custom script delegation

## Technical Learnings

### Husky v9 Architecture
- Learned that Husky v9 uses git's `core.hooksPath` to redirect to `.husky/_/`
- Understanding that `.husky/_/` contains wrapper scripts that delegate to actual hook implementations
- Knowledge of proper Husky v9 initialization and script delegation patterns

### Git Hook Debugging
- Practiced systematic approach to debugging git hooks:
  1. Manual hook execution (`.husky/pre-commit`)
  2. Checking git configuration (`git config core.hooksPath`)
  3. Verifying hook delegation chain
- Understanding the difference between hook logic bugs and configuration issues

### Complete Pre-commit Hook Implementation
- Achieved full working implementation that enforces devlog and task requirements
- Proper error messaging and documentation-only commit exemptions
- Complete test coverage of all scenarios

## Next Steps

- Update task to reflect complete resolution
- Document the final working state for future reference
- Ensure all changes are committed with proper devlog/task entries
