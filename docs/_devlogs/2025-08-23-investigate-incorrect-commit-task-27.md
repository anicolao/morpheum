## Investigation Summary

Task 27 requested investigation of an incorrect commit where `AGENTS.md` was checked in incorrectly and a change to the bot's source was missed.

## Findings

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **The Incident**: Around August 16, 2025, there was a commit workflow issue where:
   - `AGENTS.md` was committed separately from related bot source code changes
   - Changes to `src/morpheum-bot/` files were left uncommitted/unstaged
   - This created an inconsistent state where documentation was updated without the corresponding implementation

2. **Technical Cause**: The pre-commit hook logic at the time enforced strict staging requirements:
   - The hook prevented commits if there were any unstaged changes in tracked files
   - This led to situations where developers could only commit partially staged changes
   - As documented in `docs/_devlogs/2025-08-16-improve-pre-commit-hook.md`: "I made a mistake and forgot to stage all the files in a commit"

3. **Resolution**: The issue was eventually resolved in commit `433030e` (merge of PR #80), where:
   - `AGENTS.md` was properly added with full content including directory-based workflow guidelines
   - All `src/morpheum-bot/` files were added together (43+ files)
   - The commit shows status `A` (added) for both AGENTS.md and all bot source files

### Evidence Found

- **Pre-commit Hook**: `.husky/pre-commit` shows logic that checks for unstaged changes and prevents commits
- **Devlog Evidence**: `2025-08-16-improve-pre-commit-hook.md` explicitly mentions the mistake and hook improvements
- **Git History**: Commit `433030e` shows both AGENTS.md and src/morpheum-bot files being added together, indicating they were originally meant to be committed together

### Current State

The current pre-commit hook has been improved to:
- Check for unstaged changes in tracked files
- Check for untracked files that should be staged or gitignored
- Prevent editing of legacy DEVLOG.md and TASKS.md files directly
- Provide clear guidance on the directory-based workflow

## Recommendations

1. **Process Improvement**: The directory-based workflow for devlogs and tasks (already implemented) helps prevent merge conflicts and supports concurrent development

2. **Pre-commit Hook Effectiveness**: The improved pre-commit hook logic successfully prevents the type of partial commit that caused this issue

3. **Developer Education**: Ensure all contributors understand the staging requirements and use `git status` to verify all intended changes are staged before committing

4. **Documentation**: The AGENTS.md guidelines now clearly document the proper workflow, which should prevent similar issues

## Actions Taken

- [x] Analyzed git history to understand the commit issue
- [x] Reviewed pre-commit hook evolution and improvements  
- [x] Examined related devlogs for context
- [x] Documented findings and root cause
- [x] Verified current safeguards are in place

## Lessons Learned

- Pre-commit hooks must balance strictness with usability
- Partial commits can create inconsistent states between documentation and implementation
- Clear workflow documentation and automated enforcement helps prevent human errors
- The directory-based approach for devlogs/tasks effectively eliminates merge conflicts
