- **High-Level Request:**
  
  - Comment feedback: "the devlogs that are in this file should be put into the new format as part of this change; this file should be clean and tiny, describe the new process and have a direct link to the github pages version of itself"
  - Comment feedback: "in addition to the final cleanup of DEVLOG.md we should do a similar final cleanup to TASKS.md as part of this change"

- **Actions Taken:**

  - **Automated Migration Script Development:**
    - Created Python script to extract 97 individual devlog entries from DEVLOG.md changelog section
    - Created Python script to extract 74 individual task entries from TASKS.md 
    - Automated YAML front matter generation with appropriate metadata (title, date, author, tags, status, etc.)
    - Implemented filename generation following new conventions (`YYYY-MM-DD-description.md` for devlogs, `task-NNN-description.md` for tasks)

  - **Content Migration Execution:**
    - Successfully migrated all 97 devlog entries to individual files in `docs/_devlogs/`
    - Successfully migrated all 74 task entries to individual files in `docs/_tasks/`
    - Ensured proper YAML front matter format for Jekyll aggregation
    - Preserved all historical content while enabling new workflow

  - **Legacy File Cleanup:**
    - Replaced DEVLOG.md with clean, minimal file describing new workflow
    - Added comprehensive documentation of new format and process
    - Included direct links to GitHub Pages unified views
    - Replaced TASKS.md with clean, minimal file following same pattern
    - Truncated both files to remove all legacy content (reduced from 2571 to 56 lines for DEVLOG.md, 686 to 47 lines for TASKS.md)

- **Friction/Success Points:**

  - **Success:** Automated migration preserved all 171 historical entries while eliminating merge conflict sources
  - **Success:** New files follow consistent YAML front matter format enabling Jekyll aggregation
  - **Success:** Legacy files now serve as clear documentation of new workflow
  - **Success:** Both files include direct links to GitHub Pages unified views
  - **Learning:** Python automation was essential for handling 97+ entries - manual migration would have been error-prone
  - **Success:** Filename conventions enable easy chronological sorting and identification

- **Technical Learnings:**
  - **Migration Strategy:** Directory-based content management eliminates merge conflicts while preserving unified views through Jekyll aggregation
  - **YAML Front Matter:** Proper metadata structure enables sophisticated filtering, sorting, and display on GitHub Pages
  - **Automation Benefits:** Python scripts with regex parsing handle complex content extraction more reliably than manual processes
  - **Jekyll Integration:** Static site generators excel at aggregating distributed content files into unified presentations
