- **High-Level Request:**
  
  - Fix incorrect validation in the gauntlet task `check-sed-available`. The task check was observed to incorrectly validate, with gpt-5-mini passing the test but the evaluation scoring it as a fail. The validation should be similar to `add-jq`, which does pass correctly.

- **Actions Taken:**

  - **Root Cause Analysis:** Identified that `check-sed-available` was using a different validation pattern than `add-jq`:
    - `check-sed-available` used: `"which sed"` - runs outside the Nix environment 
    - `add-jq` used: `"cd /project && nix develop -c which jq"` - runs inside the Nix environment
  - **Fixed validation command:** Updated `check-sed-available` to use the same pattern as `add-jq`:
    - Changed from: `"which sed"` to `"cd /project && nix develop -c which sed"`
    - Updated validation logic from: `stdout.includes("/nix/store") && stdout.includes("sed")` to `stdout.includes("/nix/store")`
  - **Ensured consistency:** Both tasks now use identical validation patterns, testing for tool availability within the Nix environment

- **Friction/Success Points:**

  - **Success:** The fix was minimal and surgical - only 2 lines changed in the validation logic
  - **Success:** All existing tests continue to pass, ensuring no regressions
  - **Success:** Now both `add-jq` and `check-sed-available` use consistent validation that properly tests tool availability in the Nix environment rather than system tools
  - **Learning:** Validation consistency is critical - tasks testing similar functionality should use identical validation patterns to avoid false positives/negatives

- **Process Failure - Incorrect Documentation Workflow:**

  - **Critical Error:** Failed to follow the established documentation workflow by adding the devlog entry directly to `DEVLOG.md` instead of creating a new file in `docs/_devlogs/`
  - **Missing Task Update:** Also failed to update `TASKS.md` to reflect completion of the work
  - **Root Cause:** Did not read the current instructions at the top of `DEVLOG.md` which clearly state that new entries should be created in `docs/_devlogs/` instead of editing the file directly
  - **Impact:** This mistake violates the project's merge conflict prevention system and established workflow

- **Process Improvement Actions:**

  - **Immediate Fix:** Moving this entry to the correct location in `docs/_devlogs/` with proper YAML front matter
  - **Documentation Review:** Will ensure to always read current file headers and instructions before modifying any documentation files
  - **Task Tracking:** Will create appropriate task entry in `docs/_tasks/` to track this work
  - **Future Prevention:** Adding this lesson to personal workflow checklist to verify current documentation structure before making changes
