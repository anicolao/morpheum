- **Actions Taken:**
  - Investigated a reported typo where the project was mistakenly called
    "Morpheus" instead of "Morpheum". A search across all markdown files (`.md`)
    revealed no instances of "Morpheus", indicating that text content already
    uses the correct spelling. It's possible the typo exists within the
    `assets/logo.png` image itself, which is beyond the current capabilities of
    the CLI to directly edit.
