- **High-Level Request:**
  
  - Review ROADMAP.md and update it for all cases where the roadmap entry is complete. For all incomplete cases, create new incomplete tasks to reflect logical units of work to make progress on the roadmap.

- **Actions Taken:**

  - **Current State Analysis:** Conducted comprehensive analysis of the repository to understand actual implementation status vs. documented status in ROADMAP.md
  - **Roadmap Accuracy Review:** Identified several completed items that were marked as incomplete:
    - GitHub Integration: Fully implemented via CopilotClient with comprehensive API coverage
    - Agent Integration: Bot operational with full command handling and SWE-Agent integration  
    - OpenAI API Integration: Complete implementation with dual OpenAI/Ollama backend support
    - Jail Environment: Comprehensive Nix-based containerization system implemented
    - Workflow Transition: Matrix-based dogfooding is operational with restructured documentation
  - **ROADMAP.md Updates:** Updated roadmap to accurately reflect completion status:
    - Marked "Bot Development" section as "Done" with all sub-components completed
    - Updated "Workflow Transition" from "To Do" to "Done" 
    - Updated "Enhanced Tooling and Environment" items to "Done"
  - **New Task Creation:** Created 5 new task files for remaining v0.2 incomplete work:
    - Task 101: Agent Self-Correction and Learning Mechanisms
    - Task 102: Matrix Interface User Experience Enhancements
    - Task 103: Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework Design
    - Task 104: Systematic Gauntlet Testing and Benchmarking
    - Task 105: Iterative Prompt Engineering Optimization

- **Verification Process:**

  - **Code Review:** Examined src/morpheum-bot/ implementation to verify GitHub integration capabilities
  - **Test Validation:** Ran npm test to confirm all 188 tests pass, validating current functionality
  - **Infrastructure Check:** Verified jail environment, task management system, and documentation structure
  - **Historical Analysis:** Reviewed recent devlogs to understand completion timeline and current focus areas

- **Success Points:**

  - **Accurate Documentation:** ROADMAP.md now reflects actual project state rather than outdated plans
  - **Clear Task Breakdown:** Remaining v0.2 work is now broken into logical, actionable units
  - **Preserved History:** Maintained completed work history for project trajectory understanding
  - **Comprehensive Coverage:** All incomplete roadmap items now have corresponding task files

- **Technical Learnings:**

  - **Implementation Discovery:** The project is significantly more advanced than the roadmap indicated
  - **GitHub Integration Maturity:** CopilotClient provides sophisticated issue creation, PR tracking, and session management
  - **Bot Sophistication:** Full Matrix integration with markdown formatting, message queuing, and command handling
  - **Testing Infrastructure:** Comprehensive test suite with 188 passing tests demonstrates system stability
