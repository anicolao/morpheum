## Actions Taken

- **Problem Analysis**: Investigated issue #97 where the "refine-existing-codebase" gauntlet task was failing due to incorrect execution order
- **Root Cause Identified**: The validation code was creating the initial `server.js` file AFTER the bot had already attempted to modify it, overwriting the bot's work
- **Solution Implemented**: Moved file creation from the `successCondition` (validation phase) to the setup phase before bot execution
- **Key Changes**:
  - Added pre-task setup logic in `runGauntlet()` function that creates initial `server.js` file for "refine-existing-codebase" task
  - Removed file creation code from the task's `successCondition` function
  - Preserved all validation logic (testing the `/api/v1/status` endpoint and JSON response validation)

## Friction/Success Points

- **Success**: Clear problem identification - the execution order was obviously wrong when examining the code flow
- **Success**: Minimal, surgical fix - only moved existing code to the correct phase, no complex refactoring needed
- **Success**: All existing tests continue to pass after the fix
- **Success**: Clear separation of concerns - setup happens in setup phase, validation happens in validation phase
- **Learning**: Pre-commit hooks enforce documentation standards, ensuring all changes are properly tracked

## Technical Learnings

- **Execution Order in Gauntlet**: Understanding the gauntlet execution flow: container setup → readiness check → pre-task setup → bot execution → validation
- **Task Design Patterns**: Some tasks need pre-existing files ("refine" tasks) while others create files from scratch ("create" tasks)
- **Validation vs Setup**: Validation should only test results, not recreate initial conditions
- **Error Handling**: Added proper error handling for the setup phase to fail gracefully if file creation fails
- **Progress Callbacks**: Added user-friendly progress messages for the setup phase to improve visibility
