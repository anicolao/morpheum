- **Actions Taken:**
  - Reordered tasks in [`TASKS.md`](TASKS.md) to be sequential.
  - Analyzed `git log` to find the original commit dates for older, undated
    entries.
  - Reformatted the entire [`DEVLOG.md`](DEVLOG.md) to use a new, more scannable
    format with `### YYYY-MM-DD: Summary` headers.
  - Scanned the document and converted all references to local markdown files
    into hyperlinks.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - Dating the old entries required manual inspection of the git history, which
    was a slow but necessary process for accuracy.
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - Consistently linking to other project files within the devlog is crucial for
    good documentation and navigability. This should be a standard practice for
    all future entries.
