- **Actions Taken:**
  - Updated [`TASKS.md`](TASKS.md) to reflect the new plan for integrating the
    Gemini CLI using a Git submodule (`git submodule add`).
  - The previous plan involved manually copying relevant files, which was deemed
    less robust for version control and dependency management.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - Successfully identified a more robust and standard approach for managing
    external code dependencies.
  - Ensured [`TASKS.md`](TASKS.md) accurately reflects the revised development
    strategy.
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - Always consider standard version control mechanisms (like Git submodules)
    for managing external code dependencies to improve maintainability and
    update processes.
