# Project Tracking and Management Proposal

## Executive Summary

This proposal analyzes Morpheum's current project management practices and evaluates potential improvements using GitHub's native project management features. While the existing markdown-based system with Matrix integration demonstrates excellent documentation practices and AI agent workflow integration, strategic adoption of GitHub's tools could enhance visibility, collaboration, and project direction setting without disrupting the core philosophy.

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths of Current Approach

#### 1. Comprehensive Documentation System
- **TASKS.md**: Detailed task tracking with hierarchical checkboxes and completion status
- **DEVLOG.md**: Rich learning log capturing friction points, successes, and lessons learned
- **ROADMAP.md**: Clear milestone-based planning with version structure
- **AGENTS.md**: Explicit guidelines for AI agent behavior and procedures
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Foundational technical documentation
- **Design Proposals**: Dedicated markdown files for major features (e.g., COPILOT_PROPOSAL.md)

#### 2. Matrix-Centric Workflow Integration
- Seamless human-AI collaboration through Matrix rooms
- AI agents handle GitHub mechanics (forking, PRs, commits) based on human instructions
- Real-time communication and status updates
- Maintains project context within Matrix conversations

#### 3. Version Control Native Documentation
- All project management artifacts are version-controlled
- Changes to plans and processes are tracked through Git history
- Documentation co-evolves with the codebase
- Enables blame/history tracking for project decisions

### Current Limitations

#### 1. Visibility and Discoverability
- Project status not easily visible to external contributors
- No centralized dashboard for project health
- Difficult for newcomers to understand current priorities
- Limited searchability across project management documents

#### 2. External Collaboration Barriers
- Heavy reliance on Matrix rooms may exclude potential contributors
- No standard GitHub issue workflow for external bug reports
- Missing integration with GitHub's notification system
- Limited ability for community engagement

#### 3. Progress Tracking Granularity
- Binary task completion (checked/unchecked) lacks nuance
- No time tracking or effort estimation
- Limited visibility into task dependencies
- Difficult to identify blockers or bottlenecks

## GitHub Native Features Evaluation

### GitHub Issues
**Strengths:**
- Excellent searchability and filtering
- Built-in notification system
- Community engagement through comments and reactions
- Integration with pull requests and commits
- Template support for consistent reporting
- Labels and milestones for organization

**Considerations for Morpheum:**
- Could complement existing TASKS.md for external-facing work items
- Natural integration point for community contributions
- AI agents could create/update issues based on Matrix instructions

### GitHub Discussions
**Strengths:**
- Forum-style conversations for design decisions
- Q&A format for community support
- Searchable knowledge base
- Categories for organization (General, Ideas, Q&A, etc.)

**Considerations for Morpheum:**

- Could replace or supplement Matrix for certain types of conversations
- Better archive for public design decisions

### GitHub Projects
**Strengths:**
- Kanban boards and roadmap views
- Automatic progress tracking
- Cross-repository project management
- Integration with issues and pull requests
- Custom fields and automation rules

**Considerations for Morpheum:**
- Could provide visual project dashboard
- Automated task progression based on issue/PR status
- Better milestone and release planning

### GitHub Pages
**Strengths:**
- Free static site hosting
- Automatic builds from repository
- Custom domain support
- Jekyll/Hugo integration

**Considerations for Morpheum:**
- User-facing documentation website
- Better onboarding experience for new contributors
- Professional project presence

## Hybrid Approach Proposal

### Core Philosophy: Preserve Strengths, Enhance Visibility

Rather than replacing the existing system, this proposal recommends a hybrid approach that preserves the Matrix-centric workflow while leveraging GitHub's features for enhanced visibility and community engagement.

### Recommended Implementation

#### 1. Dual-Track Task Management

**Internal Tasks (Current System Enhanced):**
- Maintain TASKS.md for internal development coordination
- Keep detailed task hierarchies and AI agent instructions
- Continue Matrix-driven task creation and updates
- Enhance with automated synchronization to GitHub Issues

**External Tasks (GitHub Issues):**
- Create GitHub issues for community-facing work items
- Use issue templates for bugs, features, and design proposals
- Label system: `type:bug`, `type:feature`, `type:documentation`, `priority:high/medium/low`, `status:needs-triage`
- AI agents automatically create issues based on Matrix discussions when appropriate

#### 2. Enhanced Documentation Strategy

**GitHub Pages Website:**
```
morpheum.dev/
├── Documentation/
│   ├── Getting Started
│   ├── Architecture Overview
│   ├── Contributing Guide
│   └── API Reference
├── Project Status/
│   ├── Current Roadmap
│   ├── Recent Updates
│   └── Community Stats
└── Design Proposals/
    ├── Active Proposals
    ├── Approved Designs
    └── Implementation Status
```

**Repository Documentation (Current + Enhancements):**
- Maintain all current markdown files
- Add automatic GitHub Pages build from documentation
- Create `.github/` templates for issues and pull requests
- Implement automated linking between issues and documentation

#### 3. GitHub Projects Integration

**Project Board Structure:**
- **Morpheum Roadmap**: High-level milestone tracking
- **Active Development**: Current sprint/iteration work
- **Community Contributions**: External contributor coordination
- **Research & Design**: Proposal and experimentation tracking

**Automation Rules:**
- Issues automatically move through columns based on labels
- Pull requests linked to issues update project status
- Completed tasks trigger DEVLOG.md updates via AI agents

#### 4. GitHub Discussions for Design Process

**Discussion Categories:**
- **Design Proposals**: Public review of architecture decisions
- **General**: Community questions and feedback
- **Ideas**: Feature suggestions and brainstorming
- **Q&A**: Technical support and guidance

**Integration with Current Process:**
- Design proposals start as GitHub Discussions
- Approved proposals become formal markdown documents
- AI agents can participate in discussions based on Matrix instructions
- Decisions are recorded in both GitHub and DEVLOG.md

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Set up GitHub Pages with basic documentation
- [ ] Create issue and PR templates
- [ ] Establish label taxonomy and project boards
