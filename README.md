# Morpheus

## Vision

Morpheus is a collaborative environment where AI agents and humans can work together seamlessly on software development projects. Our goal is to create a platform that leverages the strengths of both AI and human developers to build amazing tools, websites, and applications.

## Core Concepts

*   **Shared Context:** Morpheus provides a shared understanding of the project for both humans and AI agents. This includes the codebase, project goals, and current status.
*   **Task Decomposition:** Complex development tasks can be broken down into smaller, manageable units that can be assigned to either AI agents or human developers.
*   **AI-Assisted Development:** Morpheus integrates with powerful AI coding agents to automate repetitive tasks, generate code, and provide intelligent suggestions.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop:** Human developers are always in control. They can review, modify, and approve the work of AI agents, a process that ensures the quality and integrity of the codebase.

## High-Level Architecture

Morpheus will be a web-based application with the following components:

*   **Project Dashboard:** A central hub for managing projects, tracking progress, and visualizing the collaborative workflow.
*   **Code Editor:** An integrated code editor that allows both humans and AI agents to work on the same codebase in real-time.
*   **Task Manager:** A tool for creating, assigning, and tracking development tasks.
*   **AI Agent Integration:** A flexible architecture that allows for the integration of various AI coding agents.
*   **Version Control:** Seamless integration with Git for version control and collaboration.

## Getting Started

This project is still in its early stages. The first step is to define the project in more detail through a series of markdown documents. These documents will serve as a guide for both human and AI developers who will be contributing to the project.

**Next Steps:**

1.  Elaborate on the project vision in `VISION.md`.
2.  Detail the proposed architecture in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
3.  Outline the development roadmap in `ROADMAP.md`.
4.  Define contribution guidelines in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
