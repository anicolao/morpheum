# Morpheum Workflow: Human-Bot Collaboration in Matrix Rooms

## Overview

This document outlines the intended workflow for users participating in Morpheum project rooms where humans and AI bots collaborate on software development tasks. The focus is on the user experience of working with multiple bots that have different capabilities, roles, and funding models.

## Core Concepts

### Room as Organizing Container
- A Matrix room serves as the central collaboration space for a project
- The room is associated with a specific GitHub repository (configured via PROJECT_ROOMS.md)
- Multiple bots can be present in the room, each contributing different AI capabilities
- All bots in the room are aware of the project context and repository

### Bot Ownership and Funding Model
- Each bot is owned and funded by a specific person
- Bot owners maintain control over their bot's configuration (models, costs, capabilities)
- Bot owners contribute their bot's compute resources and AI capabilities to the project
- Bot owners cannot be forced to use expensive models by other room participants

### Bot Roles and Identities
- Each bot can fulfill multiple roles through different system prompts
- Each role appears as a separate user identity in the chat room
- Roles are defined and configured by the bot owner
- Examples of roles: code reviewer, documentation writer, test generator, project manager

## User Workflow: Participating in a Project Room

### 1. Joining a Project Room

**User Journey:**
1. User receives invitation to a project room or discovers an existing room
2. User joins the room and sees:
   - Room topic indicating the associated GitHub repository
   - List of active bots and their available roles
   - Brief introduction to available bot capabilities
3. User can request current status to understand what bots are available

**Example Room Entry Experience:**
```
Welcome to the MyProject room!
ðŸ“‚ Repository: user/myproject
ðŸ¤– Available Bots:
  - Alice's Bot: @reviewer, @coder, @tester
  - Bob's Bot: @docs-writer, @architect  
  - Carol's Bot: @pm, @qa

Type !help to see available commands
Type !bots to see detailed bot capabilities
```

### 2. Understanding Available Bots and Roles

**Discovery Commands:**
- `!bots` - List all bots and their roles
- `!bots detail` - Show detailed capabilities of each bot role
- `!help [role]` - Get help for specific bot role capabilities

**Example Bot Discovery:**
```
User: !bots
Bot Response:
ðŸ¤– **Available Bots in this room:**

**Alice's Bot** (Owner: @alice:matrix.org)
- @reviewer: Code review and feedback (Model: GPT-4)
- @coder: Code generation and refactoring (Model: Claude-3.5)
- @tester: Test generation and validation (Model: Codestral)

**Bob's Bot** (Owner: @bob:matrix.org)  
- @docs-writer: Documentation and README generation (Model: Llama-3.1)
- @architect: System design and architecture guidance (Model: GPT-4)

**Carol's Bot** (Owner: @carol:matrix.org)
- @pm: Project management and task breakdown (Model: Claude-3)
- @qa: Quality assurance and testing strategy (Model: Mixtral)
```

### 3. Requesting Work from Bots

**Direct Bot Interaction:**
Users can address specific bot roles directly to request work:

```
User: @reviewer please review the authentication module in src/auth/

User: @coder can you implement the user registration endpoint based on the spec in docs/api.md?

User: @docs-writer please update the README with the new installation steps

User: @pm break down the user management feature into tasks
```

**Broadcast Requests:**
Users can make general requests that any appropriate bot can respond to:

```
User: Can someone help me debug this test failure?

User: I need help optimizing the database queries in the user service

User: Who can review my pull request #123?
```

### 4. Bot-to-Bot Collaboration

**Automatic Coordination:**
Bots can see each other's messages and coordinate work:

```
@coder: I've implemented the user registration endpoint. @tester, can you generate tests for this?

@tester: Tests generated! @reviewer, the code and tests are ready for review.

@reviewer: Code looks good, but I suggest some refactoring. @docs-writer, this needs API documentation.
```

**Explicit Bot Delegation:**
Bots can explicitly request help from other bots:

```
@pm: This feature is complex. @architect, can you design the system structure first?

@architect: Here's the proposed architecture. @coder, can you implement the core interfaces?
```

### 5. Understanding Work Status and Progress

**Status Commands:**
- `!status` - Show current project status and active work
- `!tasks` - List open tasks and assignments
- `!progress` - Show recent progress and completed work

**Example Status Display:**
```
User: !status
Bot Response:
ðŸ“Š **Project Status**

**Active Work:**
- @coder: Implementing user authentication (PR #125)
- @reviewer: Reviewing database optimization (PR #124)  
- @docs-writer: Updating API documentation

**Pending Tasks:**
- Test coverage for payment module
- Performance optimization for search
- Security audit of authentication flow

**Recent Completions:**
- âœ… User registration endpoint (completed by @coder)
- âœ… Database migration scripts (completed by @coder, reviewed by @reviewer)
```

### 6. Managing Work Priorities and Direction

**User Guidance:**
Users can provide direction and priorities to the bots:

```
User: @pm the authentication feature is our top priority. Please coordinate with the team to get this done first.

User: @all we're preparing for a demo next week. Focus on user-facing features and documentation.

User: @coder pause the optimization work, we have a critical bug in the payment system that needs immediate attention.
```

**Escalation Requests:**
When bots need human input or decisions:

```
@architect: I need a decision on the database choice for the new feature. PostgreSQL vs MongoDB pros/cons attached.

@pm: Sprint planning needed. We have more tasks than capacity. Please prioritize.

@reviewer: This PR has significant security implications. Human review recommended before merge.
```

## Communication Patterns

### Bot Identification and Addressing
- Each bot role has a unique @username that users can address directly
- Users can use @all to address all bots
- Users can use @role-type (e.g., @reviewers) to address all bots of a certain type

### Work Request Formats
- **Task Assignment:** "@role please [specific task]"
- **Question:** "@role can you help me with [problem]?"
- **Information Request:** "@role what is the status of [item]?"
- **Review Request:** "@role please review [item/PR/code]"

### Status and Progress Updates
- Bots provide regular updates on work progress
- Users can request status at any time
- Important decisions and blockers are highlighted

## Bot Capability Framework

### Categories of Bot Capabilities
1. **Code Generation** - Writing new code, implementing features
2. **Code Review** - Analyzing code quality, security, best practices
3. **Testing** - Generating tests, running test suites, validation
4. **Documentation** - Writing docs, READMEs, API documentation
5. **Project Management** - Task breakdown, planning, coordination
6. **Architecture** - System design, technical decisions, patterns
7. **Quality Assurance** - Testing strategy, quality gates, validation

### Capability Discovery
Users can discover what each bot can do:
- General capabilities (code generation, review, etc.)
- Specific expertise (frontend, backend, DevOps, etc.)
- Model limitations and strengths
- Cost/speed trade-offs

## Integration with Repository

### Automatic Context Awareness
- All bots understand the repository structure and codebase
- Bots can access recent commits, pull requests, and issues
- Repository changes trigger relevant bot notifications

### GitHub Integration
- Bots can create and update pull requests
- Bots can comment on issues and PRs
- Bots can trigger CI/CD workflows
- Work done in the chat room automatically syncs with GitHub

## Future Considerations

### Bot Marketplace and Discovery
- Users could discover and invite additional bots to rooms
- Bot owners could advertise their bot capabilities
- Quality ratings and feedback for bot performance

### Advanced Coordination
- Bots could form temporary teams for complex tasks
- Automatic work distribution based on bot capabilities
- Learning from collaboration patterns to improve coordination

### Economic Models
- Token-based payment systems for expensive AI usage
- Revenue sharing for bot contributions
- Incentives for contributing specialized bot capabilities

This workflow prioritizes user experience and natural collaboration while respecting the constraints of bot ownership and funding models. The focus is on making it easy for users to get work done while maintaining clear boundaries around bot control and capabilities.
