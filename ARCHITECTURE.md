# Architecture

The architecture of Morpheum is designed to be decentralized, flexible, and extensible. It is based on two main components: the Matrix network for communication and collaboration, and the GitHub platform for code management and version control.

## Core Components

### 1. Matrix Network

The Matrix network is a decentralized and federated real-time communication protocol. It is used in Morpheum as the primary communication channel between humans and AI agents.

*   **Project Rooms:** Each project in Morpheum has a dedicated room on the Matrix network. This room serves as the central hub for all project-related communication, including discussions, status updates, and notifications.
*   **Human-Agent Interaction:** Humans can interact with AI agents in the project room by sending commands and queries. The agents can respond with text, images, and other forms of media. A significant part of an agent's response to a request or a task will be to create a fork of the project, commit the requested changes, and create a pull request for the human developers to review and merge.
*   **Decentralization and Federation:** The federated nature of Matrix allows for a decentralized and resilient communication infrastructure. Users can run their own Matrix homeservers, giving them full control over their data and communication.

### 2. GitHub Platform

GitHub is a web-based platform for software development and version control using Git. It is used in Morpheum as the primary platform for code management, collaboration, and CI/CD.

*   **Code Repositories:** Each project in Morpheum has a dedicated repository on GitHub. This repository contains the project's source code, documentation, and other assets.
*   **Version Control:** Git is used for version control, allowing for a distributed and non-linear workflow. Developers can work on their own forks of the repository and submit pull requests to contribute their changes.
*   **Collaboration:** GitHub provides a rich set of tools for collaboration, including issue tracking, code reviews, and project management boards.
*   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions is used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). This allows for automated testing, building, and deployment of the project.

## Workflow

The typical workflow for a project in Morpheum is as follows:

1.  **Project Creation:** A new project is initiated by creating a room on the Matrix network and a corresponding repository on GitHub.
2.  **Team Formation:** Humans and AI agents are invited to join the project room on Matrix.
3.  **Task Decomposition:** The project is broken down into smaller tasks, which are assigned to either humans or AI agents.
4.  **Development:** Developers work on their assigned tasks, using Git for version control and GitHub for collaboration.
5.  **Communication:** All project-related communication takes place in the project room on Matrix.
6.  **Review and Approval:** Pull requests are reviewed by humans, who can then instruct an AI agent to perform the mechanics of approving and merging the pull request.
7.  **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions is used to automate the testing, building, and deployment of the project.

## Extensibility

The architecture of Morpheum is designed to be extensible. New AI agents, tools, and services can be easily integrated into the ecosystem.

*   **AI Agents:** New AI agents can be developed and deployed to assist with a wide range of tasks.
*   **Hardware Providers:** A marketplace of hardware providers can be created to provide the computing resources for running the AI agents.
*   **Third-Party Integrations:** Morpheum can be integrated with other third-party services, such as project management tools, code analysis services, and deployment platforms.
