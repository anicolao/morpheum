# DEVLOG

## Morpheum Development Log

This log tracks the development of `morpheum` using `morpheum` itself. Our main goal is to minimize manual work, letting AI agents handle most tasks by generating project markdown. This explains why we sometimes hit snags and have to work around them.

## Changelog

*   **Draft `TASKS.md` for Morpheum Bot:** Collaborated on creating and refining the initial `TASKS.md` to outline the development of the Morpheum Bot. The process involved reviewing all project markdown to align with the project's goals, and iteratively refining the task list based on feedback to use a local `src/morpheum-bot` directory with top-level dependencies. This exercise served as a successful test of the human-agent collaboration workflow. A minor friction point was an initial hang when reading multiple files, which was resolved by globbing for the files first.
*   **Refine `ARCHITECTURE.md` Human-Agent Interaction:** Improved clarity and conciseness in the "Human-Agent Interaction" section of `ARCHITECTURE.md` by rephrasing a long sentence into shorter, more direct ones.
*   **Refine `VISION.md`:** Made two improvements to `VISION.md`: a minor rephrasing for conciseness in the "Project Scaffolding" bullet, and a more significant correction to clarify that human developers will need to adapt to new, AI-mediated workflows for interacting with version control systems, rather than using "familiar workflows."
*   **Clarify `README.md` PR Approval:** Updated `README.md` to clarify that human participants instruct AI agents to approve pull requests, aligning with the updated `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
*   **Draft `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`:** Created the first drafts of the `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` files. The `CONTRIBUTING.md` was heavily revised to reflect the Matrix-centric, AI-agent-mediated workflow. A significant oversight was the failure to immediately log this activity in the `DEVLOG.md`, highlighting a need for stricter adherence to logging conventions.
*   **Refine `ROADMAP.md`:** Removed the "Future Goals" section, ensured all markdown files are linked, and clarified that AI agents will handle low-level GitHub command integration.
*   **Correction: Gemini CLI Language (Repeated Error):** Identified and corrected a significant, and *repeated*, error in the `ROADMAP.md` where the Gemini CLI's implementation language was consistently misrepresented. Initially, it was incorrectly assumed to be Python-based, then incorrectly stated that a Python bot would *use* it. The Gemini CLI is primarily TypeScript/JavaScript. The `ROADMAP.md` has now been updated to reflect that the Morpheum Bot will be developed in TypeScript/JavaScript, directly leveraging the forked Gemini CLI codebase. This highlights a critical learning point about the importance of external verification, avoiding assumptions, and the need for persistent self-correction when errors are identified.
*   **Draft `ROADMAP.md`:** Created the first draft of the `ROADMAP.md` file, focusing on the near-term tasks required to move to a Matrix-based workflow. The draft was reviewed and updated to include the concept of forking the Gemini CLI (explicitly noting it is Python-based) for the initial bot, the idea of each AI agent having its own GitHub account, and to ensure consistency regarding the use of Python for the bot development.
*   **Draft `ARCHITECTURE.md`:** Created the first draft of the `ARCHITECTURE.md` file, outlining the technical architecture of the Morpheum project. The draft was reviewed and updated to include the agent's ability to create forks and pull requests, and the ability for humans to instruct agents to approve and merge pull requests.
*   **Draft `VISION.md`:** Created the first draft of the `VISION.md` file, outlining the long-term vision for the Morpheum project.
*   **Markdown Hyperlinking:** Went through all markdown files and hyperlinked any references to other markdown files to make the documentation easier to navigate.
*   **Agent Guidelines (`AGENTS.md`):** Created [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) to document the expected behavior of AI agents. This was a multi-step process that involved generating the file, receiving feedback on its content, and then updating it to include the nuanced purpose of the `DEVLOG.md`. The [`README.md`](README.md) was also updated to link to this new file. A key piece of friction was that the agent (me) initially failed to follow the newly created guidelines, forgetting to update this `DEVLOG.md` after making the changes. This highlights the importance of reinforcing these new conventions.
*   **GitHub Repository Renamed:** The GitHub repository was successfully renamed from `morpheus` to `morpheum` using the `gh repo rename` command. (Note: The CLI previously incorrectly stated that this operation required manual intervention, highlighting a limitation in the CLI's knowledge base regarding `gh` CLI capabilities.)
*   **Project Renaming ("Morpheus" to "Morpheum"):** Corrected a widespread typo, renaming all instances of "Morpheus" to "Morpheum" across [`README.md`](README.md) and [`DEVLOG.md`](DEVLOG.md). This involved multiple `replace` operations. The GitHub repository itself needs to be manually renamed by the user, as this is beyond the CLI's direct capabilities.
*   **Typo Investigation ("Morpheum" to "Morpheus"):** Investigated a reported typo where the project was mistakenly called "Morpheus" instead of "Morpheum". A search across all markdown files (`.md`) revealed no instances of "Morpheus", indicating that text content already uses the correct spelling. It's possible the typo exists within the `assets/logo.png` image itself, which is beyond the current capabilities of the CLI to directly edit.
*   **Add Logo to README.md:** Added `assets/logo.png` to the repository and displayed it at the top of [`README.md`](README.md) using a markdown image link. This involved using `git add` for the image and `replace` for modifying `README.md`.
*   **DEVLOG.md Editing Pass:** Performed an editing pass on this [`DEVLOG.md`](DEVLOG.md) file to make it briefer and less formal, without losing any content. Reduced word count from 700 to 500 words. (Note: Obtaining the previous word count required instructing the Gemini CLI to use `git show` and then count words, highlighting a current friction point in fully automated metrics gathering.)
*   **GPLv3 License Added (Current):** We just added the GPLv3 license. We used `google_web_search`, `web_fetch`, and `write_file` for this. However, the file created by the CLI was eventually discarded, and the license was added manually via GitHub's UI.
*   **Initial License Attempt (MIT):** Earlier, Gemini picked an MIT license, which we didn't want. Trying to switch to GPL caused the CLI to hang during a git rebase, so we abandoned that approach.
*   **README Drafted:** The [`README.md`](README.md) was initially drafted by the Gemini CLI (`gemini-2.5-flash`). It was mostly good, but the architecture section was a hallucination and needed a rewrite.
*   **GitHub Repo Created:** A big win was the Gemini CLI creating the local GitHub repo from scratch and pushing it using `gh`. I had to authenticate manually, but the CLI handled the initial README and git setup.
*   **Project Context Setup:** We started by setting up the development environment and giving the `morpheus` CLI its current context.

### Tools Used

*   **`tmux`**: For managing multiple terminals.
*   **`Gemini CLI`**: Our main AI agent for content creation.
*   **`glow`**: For previewing markdown before pushing.
*   `google_web_search`: For research and finding license text.
*   `web_fetch`: For getting web content.
*   `write_file`: For creating and updating files.

### Frustrations

*   **Agent getting distracted by LICENSE file:** The agent paused unnecessarily each time it encountered the `LICENSE` file. This is a distraction and should be avoided. Future agents should be instructed to ignore the `LICENSE` file unless specifically asked to interact with it.
*   **`gh` CLI Limitations:** No direct `gh` command to add licenses, forcing manual steps.
*   **`web_fetch` Behavior:** Initially returned summaries instead of raw text, requiring more specific requests.
*   **CLI Instability (Git):** The Gemini CLI hung during a git rebase attempt.
*   **Inconsistent CLI Behavior:** The license addition process wasn't as smooth this time, leading to manual intervention.

### Experience Building Morpheum with Morpheum

It's been a mixed bag. The CLI's ability to interact with the file system and web is powerful. But issues like hallucinated content, CLI hangs, and inconsistent behavior show that `morpheum` still needs human oversight. While functional, the process can be indirect and sometimes unreliable, sometimes requiring manual workarounds (like adding the license via GitHub UI). All commits to the repository will now be reflected with at least one comment in this worklog to reflect the work done and any challenges encountered.
