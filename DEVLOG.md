> **‚úçÔ∏è To add new entries:** Create individual files in `docs/_devlogs/` using the format `{YYYY-MM-DD}-{description}.md` instead of editing this file directly. See the [contributing guide](https://anicolao.github.io/morpheum/documentation/contributing/) for details.

## About This Log

This development log has been migrated to a directory-based structure to resolve constant merge conflicts that occurred when multiple contributors (human developers and AI agents) tried to update the centralized file simultaneously.

### New Workflow

Each development log entry is now a separate file in the `docs/_devlogs/` directory with YAML front matter containing metadata like title, date, author, and tags. The files are automatically aggregated into a unified view on the GitHub Pages site in reverse chronological order.

### Format

New devlog entries should follow this format:

```yaml
---
title: "Brief description of the work done"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
author: "Your name or GitHub Copilot Agent"
tags: ["relevant", "tags"]
---

- **High-Level Request:**
  - Brief description of what was requested or needed

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Detailed list of what was accomplished
  - Technical changes made
  - Files modified

- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - What went well
  - What was challenging
  - Lessons learned

- **Technical Learnings:**
  - New techniques discovered
  - Best practices identified
  - Knowledge gained for future reference
```

### Viewing the Complete Log

The unified development log with all entries is available at: [https://anicolao.github.io/morpheum/status/devlogs/](https://anicolao.github.io/morpheum/status/devlogs/)

**Total entries migrated:** 108 development log entries spanning from project inception to the present.
