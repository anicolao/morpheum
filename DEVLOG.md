## Development Process Log - Morpheus using Morpheus

This log details the development process of the `morpheus` project, highlighting the tools used, any deficiencies or frustrations encountered, and the overall experience of building `morpheus` using itself as a development environment. A core goal of this project is to minimize direct manual work on the repository, preferring to use AI agents to write the markdown that defines the project, and then use that markdown to generate the project itself. This goal helps explain why some frustrations are encountered and only reluctantly worked around.

## Changelog

*   **Adding GPLv3 License (Current Process):** The primary task in the current iteration was to add a GPLv3 license to the repository. This process, as documented, involved using `google_web_search`, `web_fetch`, and `write_file`. However, the license file found and created by the CLI was ultimately discarded, and the license was added manually via GitHub's UI.
*   **Initial License Attempt (MIT):** An earlier attempt to add a license involved Gemini picking the MIT license, which was not desired. An attempt to replace it with GPL led to the Gemini CLI hanging while guiding a rebase to remove the MIT commit.
*   **README Drafting:** The `README.md` was initially drafted using the Gemini CLI with the `gemini-2.5-flash` model. While mostly acceptable, the initial architecture section was a hallucination and required regeneration with specific content.
*   **Initial GitHub Repository Creation:** A significant high point was the Gemini CLI's ability to initiate the project by creating a local GitHub repository from scratch. It then successfully used the `gh` command-line tool to push this repository to GitHub. Although manual authentication was required, the Gemini CLI managed all steps of creating the initial README locally, setting up the local Git repository, and pushing it to the remote.
*   **Project Context Setup:** The initial phase involved setting up the development environment and providing the `morpheus` CLI with the necessary context, including the current working directory and folder structure.

### Tools Used

*   **`tmux`**: Used to allow multiple terminals to work concurrently on the project, facilitating a multi-faceted development environment.
*   **`Gemini CLI`**: The primary tool used to create all the content within this project, acting as the AI agent for development.
*   **`glow`**: Employed as the markdown preview tool, enabling human participants to review the generated markdown content before pushing it to GitHub.
*   `google_web_search`: Used to research `gh` command capabilities and to find the official GPLv3 license text.
*   `web_fetch`: Used to retrieve the content of the GPLv3 license from the GNU website.
*   `write_file`: Used to create and populate the `LICENSE` file with the GPLv3 text (though this file was later discarded).

### Deficiencies and Frustrations

*   **`gh` CLI Limitation:** A notable deficiency was the absence of a direct `gh` command to add a license. This necessitated a manual process of searching for the license text and creating the file, rather than a streamlined, automated approach through the `gh` CLI.
*   **`web_fetch` Initial Behavior:** The `web_fetch` tool initially returned a summarized version of the web page content when asked for the GPLv3 license text, rather than the raw, full text. This required a second, more specific request to obtain the complete license content, adding an extra step to the process.
*   **CLI Instability during Git Operations:** The Gemini CLI hung during an attempt to guide a git rebase operation to remove an unwanted MIT license commit. This highlights potential instability or limitations when performing complex interactive git operations.
*   **Inconsistent CLI Behavior:** The current license addition process did not work as smoothly as a previous, undocumented attempt, leading to the user manually adding the license via GitHub's UI. This suggests potential inconsistencies in the CLI's ability to reliably execute multi-step processes.

### Experience of Building Morpheus using Morpheus

The experience has been a mix of promising capabilities and frustrating limitations. The ability to directly interact with the file system and external web resources is powerful, as demonstrated by the successful retrieval and writing of the license text. However, the issues encountered with hallucinated content, CLI hangs during git operations, and inconsistent behavior in multi-step processes indicate that while `morpheus` can be a valuable tool, it still requires significant user oversight and intervention. The iterative process of using `google_web_search` and `web_fetch` to gather information and then `write_file` to implement changes showcases a functional, albeit sometimes indirect and unreliable, approach to common development tasks. The need to resort to manual intervention (e.g., adding the license via GitHub UI) underscores the current limitations in fully autonomous execution of complex workflows.
