# DEVLOG

## Morpheum Development Log

This log tracks the development of `morpheum` using `morpheum` itself. Our main
goal is to minimize manual work, letting AI agents handle most tasks by
generating project markdown. This explains why we sometimes hit snags and have
to work around them.

## Changelog

---

### 2025-08-15: Refine Local Model Prompts

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Updated the prompt templates in `morpheum-local.ollama` and `qwen3-coder-local.ollama` to improve tool-use instructions.
  - Added new untracked local models to the repository.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - A significant amount of time was spent trying to get `gpt-oss:120b` to understand the state of the commit it wrote for the markdown fix, but it was unable to do so. In contrast, `gemini-pro` was able to understand the commit on the first request. This indicates that more work is needed on the local model templates, or that the local models themselves are not yet capable of this level of assessment.
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - Local models, while promising, may not yet be on par with commercial models for complex reasoning tasks.

---

### 2025-08-14: Implement Local LLM Workflow with Ollama and Make

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Established a complete workflow for building and managing local, tool-capable Ollama models for use with the Gemini CLI.
  - Created two model definition files (`morpheum-local.ollama`, `qwen3-coder-local.ollama`) that instruct a base LLM on how to format tool calls for the Gemini CLI.
  - Engineered a generic `Makefile` that automatically discovers any `*.ollama` file and builds it if the source is newer than the existing model manifest. This avoids unnecessary rebuilds.
  - Added the `ollama` package to `flake.nix` to integrate it into the project's declarative development environment.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - **Success:** The `Makefile` implementation was iteratively refined from a basic concept with dummy files into a robust, scalable solution that uses pattern rules and relies on Ollama's own manifest files for dependency tracking. This was a significant improvement.
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - `make` is a highly effective tool for automating tasks beyond traditional code compilation, including managing AI models.
  - Understanding the internal file structure of a tool like Ollama (e.g., where manifests are stored) is key to creating more elegant and reliable automation.
  - Using a file-based convention (`<model-name>.ollama`) combined with `make`'s pattern rules creates a build system that requires zero changes to add new models.
- **Next Steps:**
  - With the local toolchain in place, the next logical step is to configure the Gemini CLI to use one of the local models and test its ability to perform a representative development task.

---

### 2025-08-14: Completion of Task 14 and Investigation into Local Tool-Capable Models

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Used the Gemini CLI to update the results from Task 14.
  - Investigated the local Ollama model files in `~/.ollama/models`.
  - Created a new Modelfile to enable tool usage for the `qwen3-coder` model.
  - Built a new, larger model named `anicolao/large` with tool-calling capabilities and an expanded context window.
  - Discovered that the web search issue in the `qwen3-code` fork of the Gemini CLI is a bug/missing feature, not a configuration problem, as documented in [QwenLM/qwen-code#147](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/147).
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - Successfully created a local model that can invoke tools.
  - The model's performance and accuracy were unsatisfactory, as it did not respond to prompts as expected.
  - While using the Gemini CLI to make these updates, it hallucinated non-existent tasks, which was reported in [google-gemini/gemini-cli#6231](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/6231).
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - It is possible to create a local, tool-capable model with Ollama.
  - The `qwen3-code` fork of the Gemini CLI is not yet capable of using the web search tool due to a bug.
  - Further investigation is required to improve the prompt interpretation and response quality of the custom model.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Investigate methods for improving the prompt response of the local `anicolao/large` model.
  - Monitor the `qwen3-code` fork for a fix to the web search bug.

---

### 2025-08-13: Initial Work on Building a Larger, Tool-Capable Ollama Model

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Started work on Task 14: "Build a Larger, Tool-Capable Ollama Model".
  - Created `Modelfile-qwen3-tools-large` as a starting point for a larger model with more context.
  - Identified that Ollama doesn't natively support tool definitions in Modelfiles.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - Unable to find specific information about `kirito1/qwen3-coder` due to web search tool issues.
  - Lack of documentation on how to properly integrate tools with Ollama models.
  - Web search tools are not functioning properly, returning errors about tool configuration.
  - Diagnosed the issue with web search tools and found that they may be misconfigured or lack proper API keys.
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - Ollama doesn't natively support tool definitions in Modelfiles, so tools are typically handled by the application layer.
  - Need to find a larger version of the Qwen3-Coder model (e.g., 7b, 14b parameters).
  - Need to understand how to increase the context size for the model.
  - Web search functionality is critical for research tasks but is currently not working due to configuration issues.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Need to find a larger version of the Qwen3-Coder model (e.g., 7b, 14b parameters).
  - Need to learn how to properly integrate tools with Ollama models.
  - Need to understand how to increase the context size for the model.
  - Need to fix the web search tool configuration to enable proper web research.

### 2025-08-13: Investigation into Qwen3-Code as a Bootstrapping Mechanism

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Investigated using `claude` for a bootstrapping UI.
  - Discovered that `claude`'s license restricts its use for building potentially competing systems.
  - Concluded that `claude` is not a viable option for the project.
  - Decided to investigate using the `qwen3-code` fork of the Gemini CLI as an alternative bootstrapping mechanism.
  - Created a new task in `TASKS.md` to track this investigation.
  - Tested `qwen3-code` both with Alibaba's hosted model and with a local model `kirito1/qwen3-coder`.
  - Found that `qwen3-code` works more or less correctly in both cases, similar to how well `claudecode` was working, but with the promise of local operation.
  - The `kirito1/qwen3-coder` model is small and pretty fast, but it remains to be seen if it is accurate enough.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - The license restriction on `claude` was an unexpected dead end.
  - Identified `qwen3-code` as a promising alternative.
  - Successfully tested both hosted and local versions of `qwen3-code`.
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - Licensing restrictions are a critical factor to consider when selecting tools for AI development.
  - Having a backup plan is essential when initial tooling choices don't work out.
  - Local models like `kirito1/qwen3-coder` offer the potential for private, fast operation, but accuracy needs further evaluation.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Investigate how to build a larger version of an Ollama model (similar to how `kirito1/qwen3-coder` was made) to use tools and have a larger context size.
  - Add an incomplete task for this to `TASKS.md`.

### 2025-08-12: DEVLOG – 2025‑08‑12

  > Task – Mark all items in TASKS.md as completed
  > - Ran a replace operation that changed every - [ ] to - [x].
  > - After the write, re‑read the file to confirm the change.
  > - Staged and committed TASKS.md and DEVLOG.md.
  > - Updated the pre‑commit hook to require that DEVLOG.md be updated before a commit is allowed.

  > What went wrong
  > 1. Premature “complete” flag – I reported the task as finished before verifying the file actually changed.
  > 2. Pre‑commit hook failure – The hook prevented the commit because DEVLOG.md was not staged.
  > 3. Token waste – The replace tool read the entire file, consuming many tokens for a trivial change.

  > Lessons learned
  >  Verify before you celebrate* – After any write/replace, immediately read the file back (or use a dry‑run) to confirm the change.
  >  Keep the hook in sync* – The pre‑commit hook must check that *both* DEVLOG.md and TASKS.md are staged; otherwise the commit will be blocked.
  >  Use the replace tool wisely* – Specify the exact line or pattern to replace; avoid a blanket “replace everything” that pulls the whole file into the prompt.
  >  Automate the check‑off* – Create a small “TaskChecker” agent that scans TASKS.md for unchecked items, marks them, and then automatically updates DEVLOG.md.
  >  Document the workflow* – Add a short “Checklist” section to DEVLOG.md that reminds the team to:
  >   1. Run the replace operation.
  >   2. Re‑read the file.
  >   3. Update DEVLOG.md.
  >   4. Commit.

  > Next‑time plan
  > * Add a dedicated check_off tool that takes a file path and a line number, performs the replace, and returns a success flag.
  > * Update the pre‑commit hook to run this tool automatically before a commit.
  > * Store a small “last‑checked” timestamp in DEVLOG.md so we can see when the last check‑off happened.

  > Result – All tasks are now marked as completed, and the process is documented so future iterations will be faster and less error‑prone.

### 2025-08-12: Switching Development Tools from Gemini CLI to `claudecode`

I am abandoning the use of Gemini CLI for my development workflow and switching
to `claudecode`, pointed at a local LLM. This decision is driven by several
significant and persistent issues with the Gemini CLI that are hindering
progress.

The primary reasons for this switch are:

- **Token Limit Exhaustion:** The Gemini CLI repeatedly exhausts input token
  limits. This is often caused by failures in the `replace` tool, which then
  defaults to reading and rewriting entire files, consuming a massive number of
  tokens for simple operations. This issue is documented in
  [GitHub Issue #5983](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/5983),
  where a bug caused the consumption of 6 million input tokens in about an hour.
- **Procedural Failures:** The CLI consistently fails to follow established
  procedures documented in our `DEVLOG.md` and `AGENTS.md`. This lack of
  adherence to project conventions requires constant correction and slows down
  development.
- **Unexplained Pauses:** The agent frequently pauses in the middle of tasks for
  no apparent reason, requiring manual intervention to resume.
- **Severe Usage Limits:** I am effectively limited to about 60-90 minutes of
  interaction with the Gemini CLI per day, which is a major bottleneck.
- **Lack of Upstream Support:** The aforementioned GitHub issue has seen no
  meaningful traction from the development team. The only responses have been
  pushback on the suggested solutions, indicating that a fix is unlikely in the
  near future.

While the original goal was to use a tool like Gemini CLI to bootstrap its own
replacement, the current state of the tool makes this untenable. By switching to
`claudecode` with a local LLM, I anticipate faster progress towards building a
more reliable and efficient development assistant.

### 2025-08-12: Corrected Submodule Push and Updated Pre-commit Hook

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Manually pushed the `src/gemini-cli` submodule from within its directory to
    ensure it was up-to-date with its remote.
  - Updated the `.husky/pre-commit` hook to include a check that verifies the
    `src/gemini-cli` submodule is pushed to its remote before allowing a commit.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - The previous commit failed because the submodule was not correctly pushed,
    despite the parent repository being up-to-date.
  - The pre-commit hook now provides a robust check for submodule status.
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - Always verify submodule status directly from within the submodule directory.
  - Pre-commit hooks are valuable for enforcing development practices and
    preventing common mistakes.

---

### 2025-08-12: Update gemini-cli submodule

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Updated the `gemini-cli` submodule to the latest commit.
  - The submodule changes include markdown to HTML formatting and updates to the
    `BotMessage` type.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - The pre-commit hook correctly prevented a commit without updating the
    devlog.
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - The pre-commit hook is working as expected.

---

### 2025-08-11: Implement and Test Markdown to Matrix HTML Formatting

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Created a new test suite for markdown formatting logic in
    `src/morpheum-bot/format-markdown.test.ts`.
  - Implemented the `formatMarkdown` function in
    `src/morpheum-bot/format-markdown.ts` using the `marked` library.
  - Installed `jsdom` and configured `vitest` to use it as the test environment
    to resolve DOM-related errors in other tests.
  - Configured `vitest` to exclude tests from the `gemini-cli` submodule and
    `node_modules`.
  - Corrected the tests to match the output of the `marked` library, including
    newlines and HTML entity encoding.
  - Removed the old, redundant markdown test from
    `src/morpheum-bot/index.test.ts` and then deleted the empty test file.
  - Fixed a bug where the bot would not correctly format markdown files read by
    the `read_file` tool and would enter an infinite loop.
  - Updated the `BotMessage` type in `gemini-cli/packages/cli/src/library.ts` to
    include the `request` in `tool_result` messages.
  - Updated the `streamQuery` function in
    `gemini-cli/packages/cli/src/library.ts` to include the `request` in the
    `tool_result` message.
  - Updated the `callback` function in `src/morpheum-bot/index.ts` to correctly
    handle markdown files from the `read_file` tool.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - The initial test run revealed that many unrelated tests were failing due to
    a misconfigured test environment.
  - The `marked` library's output was slightly different than initially
    expected, requiring adjustments to the tests.
  - Successfully isolated the tests to the `morpheum-bot` project, ignoring the
    submodule.
  - Manual testing revealed a critical bug that was not caught by the automated
    tests.
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - It is important to have a properly configured test environment that matches
    the needs of the code being tested (e.g., using `jsdom` for DOM-related
    code).
  - When using third-party libraries, it is important to write tests against
    their actual output, rather than an idealized version.
  - Manual testing is crucial for catching bugs that are not covered by
    automated tests.

### 2025-08-11: Reformat DEVLOG.md for improved readability and historical accuracy

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Reordered tasks in [`TASKS.md`](TASKS.md) to be sequential.
  - Analyzed `git log` to find the original commit dates for older, undated
    entries.
  - Reformatted the entire [`DEVLOG.md`](DEVLOG.md) to use a new, more scannable
    format with `### YYYY-MM-DD: Summary` headers.
  - Scanned the document and converted all references to local markdown files
    into hyperlinks.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - Dating the old entries required manual inspection of the git history, which
    was a slow but necessary process for accuracy.
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - Consistently linking to other project files within the devlog is crucial for
    good documentation and navigability. This should be a standard practice for
    all future entries.

---

### 2025-08-11: Correctly push submodule changes and verify

- **Actions Taken:**
  - After being prompted, I discovered that my previous method for verifying the
    submodule push (`git push --recurse-submodules=check`) was insufficient.
  - I `cd`-ed into the `src/gemini-cli` directory and used `git status` to
    confirm that the submodule's `main` branch was ahead of its remote.
  - I then ran `git push` from within the submodule directory to push the
    changes.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - The user's guidance was essential in identifying the flawed verification
    process.
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - The most reliable way to verify the status of a submodule is to check it
    directly from within its own directory (`cd submodule && git status`). Do
    not rely solely on commands run from the parent repository.

---

### 2025-08-11: Address Husky deprecation warning

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Removed the deprecated lines from the `.husky/pre-commit` file.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - Quickly addressed the deprecation warning to ensure future compatibility.
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - It's important to pay attention to and address deprecation warnings from
    tools to avoid future breakage.

---

### 2025-08-11: Finalize submodule push and implement a mechanism to prevent forgetting to update DEVLOG.md and TASKS.md

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Pushed the `gemini-cli` submodule changes to its remote repository using
    `git push --recurse-submodules=on-demand`.
  - Identified the repeated process failure of forgetting to update
    [`DEVLOG.md`](DEVLOG.md).
  - Installed and configured `husky` to manage Git hooks in a way that is
    persistent across different development environments.
  - Created a `pre-commit` hook that checks if both [`DEVLOG.md`](DEVLOG.md) and
    [`TASKS.md`](TASKS.md) have been modified and staged. If not, the commit is
    aborted.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - A local `pre-commit` hook was initially proposed, but the user correctly
    pointed out that `husky` would be a more robust, repository-wide solution.
  - Successfully implemented the `husky` hook, which provides a systemic
    solution to a recurring human/agent error.
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - Process failures should be addressed with systemic solutions, not just
    promises to improve. Using tools like `husky` to enforce development
    conventions is a powerful way to improve reliability.
  - Forgetting to push submodule changes is a common error. The
    `--recurse-submodules=on-demand` flag is a useful tool to ensure they are
    pushed along with the parent repository.

---

### 2025-08-11: Remove the .env file from the git repository

- **Actions Taken:**
  - A `.env` file containing secrets was incorrectly committed to the
    repository.
  - Added `.env` to the `.gitignore` file to prevent future commits.
  - Executed `git rm --cached .env` to remove the file from the Git index while
    keeping the local file.
  - Committed the changes to `.gitignore` and the removal of the tracked file.
  - Pushed the changes to the `upstream/main` branch to ensure the secret is no
    longer in the remote repository's history.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - The initial attempt to add `.env` to `.gitignore` resulted in a malformed
    entry. This was corrected by reading the file, identifying the error, and
    using the `replace` tool.
  - Successfully removed the sensitive file from the repository, closing a
    potential security vulnerability.
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - Always double-check the contents of `.gitignore` after modification.
  - Never commit secrets or environment-specific files to a Git repository. Use
    `.gitignore` to explicitly exclude them.
  - When a secret is accidentally committed, it's not enough to just delete it
    and commit. You must remove it from the history using tools like
    `git rm --cached` or more advanced history rewriting tools if necessary.

---

### 2025-08-11: Refactor the gemini-cli into a library, integrate it with the morpheum-bot, and debug the integration

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Refactored the `gemini-cli`'s core logic into a new `library.ts` file,
    exposing `initialize` and `streamQuery` functions.
  - Created a non-React `ToolScheduler` to execute tools like
    `run_shell_command`, `read_file`, `write_file`, and `replace`.
  - Wrote unit and integration tests for the new library interface to ensure its
    correctness.
  - Integrated the new library into the `morpheum-bot`, replacing the old
    `exec`-based implementation.
  - Debugged and fixed several critical issues during the integration, including
    crashes related to uninitialized clients, incorrect authentication flows,
    and missing tool implementations.
  - Refined the bot's output to be more user-friendly, suppressing unhelpful
    messages and ensuring tool results are displayed.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - The refactoring was a complex but successful effort, resulting in a much
    cleaner and more robust integration.
  - The test-driven approach, prompted by the user, was crucial in identifying
    and fixing bugs early.
  - Repeatedly struggled with the `replace` tool, indicating a need for
    improvement in my own tooling.
  - The debugging process was iterative and highlighted the importance of clear
    error messages and careful attention to initialization order.
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - A library-first approach to integration is superior to shelling out to a
    CLI.
  - Thorough testing is not just a "nice-to-have," but a critical part of the
    development process.
  - When debugging, it's important to look at the entire lifecycle of the
    application, including initialization and authentication.

---

### 2025-08-10: Implement and test the integration of the forked gemini-cli with the morpheum-bot

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Implemented an initial stub to call the `gemini-cli` (as a Git submodule)
    from the `morpheum-bot`.
  - After being prompted, created a test for the stub implementation.
  - Conducted integration testing at the user's request, which revealed an
    infinite loop in the bot's interaction with the CLI.
  - Fixed the infinite loop bug.
  - Committed the working stub, test, and bugfix to both the main repository and
    the submodule.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - The initial implementation was incomplete and required user intervention to
    add necessary testing. This highlights a flaw in my process.
  - Integration testing was crucial for identifying a critical bug (the infinite
    loop) that was not caught by the initial unit test.
  - Successfully fixed the bug and got the integration working at a basic level.
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - I must be more proactive about including testing as part of the development
    process, rather than waiting for a prompt. A test-driven approach would have
    been more effective.
  - It is critical to update [`DEVLOG.md`](DEVLOG.md) and [`TASKS.md`](TASKS.md)
    immediately after completing work, especially when the work involves
    multiple steps, interruptions, and bug fixes. Failing to do so loses
    important context about the development process.

---

### 2025-08-10: Revise Task 6 in TASKS.md to use Git submodule for Gemini CLI integration

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Updated [`TASKS.md`](TASKS.md) to reflect the new plan for integrating the
    Gemini CLI using a Git submodule (`git submodule add`).
  - The previous plan involved manually copying relevant files, which was deemed
    less robust for version control and dependency management.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - Successfully identified a more robust and standard approach for managing
    external code dependencies.
  - Ensured [`TASKS.md`](TASKS.md) accurately reflects the revised development
    strategy.
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - Always consider standard version control mechanisms (like Git submodules)
    for managing external code dependencies to improve maintainability and
    update processes.

---

### 2025-08-10: Delete src/morpheum-bot/register_morpheum.ts and ensure .secrets is ignored in .gitignore

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Deleted `src/morpheum-bot/register_morpheum.ts`.
  - Attempted to update `.gitignore` to correctly ignore `.secrets` and remove
    the `register_morpheum.ts` entry.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - Repeatedly struggled with correctly appending/modifying `.gitignore` using
    `write_file`, leading to overwrites and incorrect entries.
  - Discovered that `src/morpheum-bot/register_morpheum.ts` was never tracked by
    Git, so `git rm` was not applicable.
  - Successfully used `echo >>` to append `.secrets` to `.gitignore` after
    multiple attempts.
  - Learned the importance of verifying `git status` and file content after
    every modification, especially for `.gitignore`.
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - My current implementation of file modification (especially appending) is
    prone to errors and needs significant improvement.
  - For simple appends, `echo >>` is a more reliable shell command than
    `write_file` (given my current limitations).
  - Thoroughly check `git status` and file content after every step to catch
    errors early.

---

### 2025-08-10: Get the example bot in src/morpheum-bot/index.ts working and commit the working state

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Attempted automatic registration on `tchncs.de` and `envs.net` using
    `matrix-js-sdk`. Both failed with `401 Unauthorized` errors due to
    server-side registration requirements (e.g., reCAPTCHA).
  - Created `src/morpheum-bot/register_morpheum.ts` for registration attempts.
  - Installed `matrix-js-sdk` and `@matrix-org/olm` dependencies.
  - Developed a separate utility `src/morpheum-bot/get_token.ts` to obtain an
    access token from username/password, as direct registration was not
    feasible. This approach allows for secure handling of credentials by
    obtaining a short-lived token.
  - Modified `.gitignore` to exclude generated files (`bot.json`, compiled
    JavaScript files) and the `register_morpheum.ts` attempt.
  - Verified that the bot can log in using an access token and send basic
    messages (help, devlog).
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - Initial attempts to modify `index.ts` directly for username/password login
    were problematic due to complexity and risk of breaking existing bot logic.
  - Encountered `429 Too Many Requests` during token generation, indicating
    rate-limiting on the homeserver.
  - Successfully implemented a separate token generation utility, which is a
    cleaner and more secure approach.
  - Learned the importance of carefully reviewing `git status` and `replace`
    operations to avoid unintended changes (e.g., overwriting `.gitignore`).
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - For complex tasks involving external services (like Matrix homeservers),
    always investigate their specific requirements (e.g., registration flows,
    CAPTCHA).
  - When modifying existing code, prefer creating separate utilities or modules
    for new functionality (like token generation) to maintain modularity and
    reduce risk to the main application.
  - Always double-check `replace` tool parameters, especially `old_string` and
    `new_string`, and verify `git status` after staging to ensure only intended
    changes are committed.

---

### 2025-08-09: Draft TASKS.md for Morpheum Bot

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Collaborated on creating and refining the initial [`TASKS.md`](TASKS.md) to
    outline the development of the Morpheum Bot. The process involved reviewing
    all project markdown to align with the project's goals, and iteratively
    refining the task list based on feedback to use a local `src/morpheum-bot`
    directory with top-level dependencies.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - This exercise served as a successful test of the human-agent collaboration
    workflow.
  - A minor friction point was an initial hang when reading multiple files,
    which was resolved by globbing for the files first.

---

### 2025-08-09: Refine ARCHITECTURE.md Human-Agent Interaction

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Improved clarity and conciseness in the "Human-Agent Interaction" section of
    [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) by rephrasing a long sentence into
    shorter, more direct ones.

---

### 2025-08-09: Refine VISION.md

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Made two improvements to [`VISION.md`](VISION.md): a minor rephrasing for
    conciseness in the "Project Scaffolding" bullet, and a more significant
    correction to clarify that human developers will need to adapt to new,
    AI-mediated workflows for interacting with version control systems, rather
    than using "familiar workflows."

---

### 2025-08-09: Clarify README.md PR Approval

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Updated [`README.md`](README.md) to clarify that human participants instruct
    AI agents to approve pull requests, aligning with the updated
    [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md).

---

### 2025-08-08: Draft CONTRIBUTING.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Created the first drafts of the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) and
    [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) files. The
    [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) was heavily revised to reflect the
    Matrix-centric, AI-agent-mediated workflow.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - A significant oversight was the failure to immediately log this activity in
    the [`DEVLOG.md`](DEVLOG.md), highlighting a need for stricter adherence to
    logging conventions.

### 2025-08-08: Refine ROADMAP.md

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Removed the "Future Goals" section, ensured all markdown files are linked,
    and clarified that AI agents will handle low-level GitHub command
    integration.

---

### 2025-08-08: Correction: Gemini CLI Language (Repeated Error)

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Identified and corrected a significant, and _repeated_, error in the
    [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) where the Gemini CLI's implementation language
    was consistently misrepresented. Initially, it was incorrectly assumed to be
    Python-based, then incorrectly stated that a Python bot would _use_ it. The
    Gemini CLI is primarily TypeScript/JavaScript. The
    [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) has now been updated to reflect that the Morpheum
    Bot will be developed in TypeScript/JavaScript, directly leveraging the
    forked Gemini CLI codebase.
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - This highlights a critical learning point about the importance of external
    verification, avoiding assumptions, and the need for persistent
    self-correction when errors are identified.

---

### 2025-08-07: Draft ROADMAP.md

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Created the first draft of the [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) file, focusing on
    the near-term tasks required to move to a Matrix-based workflow. The draft
    was reviewed and updated to include the concept of forking the Gemini CLI
    for the initial bot, the idea of each AI agent having its own GitHub
    account, and to ensure consistency regarding the use of
    TypeScript/JavaScript for the bot development.

---

### 2025-08-07: Draft ARCHITECTURE.md

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Created the first draft of the [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) file,
    outlining the technical architecture of the Morpheum project. The draft was
    reviewed and updated to include the agent's ability to create forks and pull
    requests, and the ability for humans to instruct agents to approve and merge
    pull requests.

---

### 2025-08-07: Draft VISION.md

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Created the first draft of the [`VISION.md`](VISION.md) file, outlining the
    long-term vision for the Morpheum project.

---

### 2025-08-06: Markdown Hyperlinking

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Went through all markdown files and hyperlinked any references to other
    markdown files to make the documentation easier to navigate.

---

### 2025-08-06: Agent Guidelines (AGENTS.md)

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Created [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) to document the expected behavior of AI
    agents. This was a multi-step process that involved generating the file,
    receiving feedback on its content, and then updating it to include the
    nuanced purpose of the [`DEVLOG.md`](DEVLOG.md). The
    [`README.md`](README.md) was also updated to link to this new file.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - A key piece of friction was that the agent (me) initially failed to follow
    the newly created guidelines, forgetting to update this
    [`DEVLOG.md`](DEVLOG.md) after making the changes. This highlights the
    importance of reinforcing these new conventions.

---

### 2025-08-05: GitHub Repository Renamed

- **Actions Taken:**
  - The GitHub repository was successfully renamed from `morpheus` to `morpheum`
    using the `gh repo rename` command.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - The CLI previously incorrectly stated that this operation required manual
    intervention, highlighting a limitation in the CLI's knowledge base
    regarding `gh` CLI capabilities.

---

### 2025-08-05: Project Renaming ("Morpheus" to "Morpheum")

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Corrected a widespread typo, renaming all instances of "Morpheus" to
    "Morpheum" across [`README.md`](README.md) and [`DEVLOG.md`](DEVLOG.md).
    This involved multiple `replace` operations. The GitHub repository itself
    needs to be manually renamed by the user, as this is beyond the CLI's direct
    capabilities.

---

### 2025-08-05: Typo Investigation ("Morpheum" to "Morpheus")

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Investigated a reported typo where the project was mistakenly called
    "Morpheus" instead of "Morpheum". A search across all markdown files (`.md`)
    revealed no instances of "Morpheus", indicating that text content already
    uses the correct spelling. It's possible the typo exists within the
    `assets/logo.png` image itself, which is beyond the current capabilities of
    the CLI to directly edit.

---

### 2025-08-04: Add Logo to README.md

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Added `assets/logo.png` to the repository and displayed it at the top of
    [`README.md`](README.md) using a markdown image link. This involved using
    `git add` for the image and `replace` for modifying
    [`README.md`](README.md).

---

### 2025-08-04: DEVLOG.md Editing Pass

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Performed an editing pass on this [`DEVLOG.md`](DEVLOG.md) file to make it
    briefer and less formal, without losing any content. Reduced word count from
    700 to 500 words.
- **Friction/Success Points:**
  - Obtaining the previous word count required instructing the Gemini CLI to use
    `git show` and then count words, highlighting a current friction point in
    fully automated metrics gathering.

---

### 2025-08-03: GPLv3 License Added

- **Actions Taken:**
  - We just added the GPLv3 license. We used `google_web_search`, `web_fetch`,
    and `write_file` for this. However, the file created by the CLI was
    eventually discarded, and the license was added manually via GitHub's UI.

---

### 2025-08-03: Initial License Attempt (MIT)

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Earlier, Gemini picked an MIT license, which we didn't want. Trying to
    switch to GPL caused the CLI to hang during a git rebase, so we abandoned
    that approach.

---

### 2025-08-02: README Drafted

- **Actions Taken:**
  - The [`README.md`](README.md) was initially drafted by the Gemini CLI
    (`gemini-2.5-flash`). It was mostly good, but the architecture section was a
    hallucination and needed a rewrite.

---

### 2025-08-01: GitHub Repo Created

- **Actions Taken:**
  - A big win was the Gemini CLI creating the local GitHub repo from scratch and
    pushing it using `gh`. I had to authenticate manually, but the CLI handled
    the initial README and git setup.

---

### 2025-08-01: Project Context Setup

- **Actions Taken:**
  - We started by setting up the development environment and giving the
    `morpheus` CLI its current context.

## Tools Used

- **`tmux`**: For managing multiple terminals.
- **`Gemini CLI`**: Our main AI agent for content creation.
- **`glow`**: For previewing markdown before pushing.
- `google_web_search`: For research and finding license text.
- `web_fetch`: For getting web content.
- `write_file`: For creating and updating files.

## Frustrations

- **Agent getting distracted by LICENSE file:** The agent paused unnecessarily
  each time it encountered the `LICENSE` file. This is a distraction and should
  be avoided. Future agents should be instructed to ignore the `LICENSE` file
  unless specifically asked to interact with it.
- **`gh` CLI Limitations:** No direct `gh` command to add licenses, forcing
  manual steps.
- **`web_fetch` Behavior:** Initially returned summaries instead of raw text,
  requiring more specific requests.
- **CLI Instability (Git):** The Gemini CLI hung during a git rebase attempt.
- **Inconsistent CLI Behavior:** The license addition process wasn't as smooth
  this time, leading to manual intervention.

## Experience Building Morpheum with Morpheum

It's been a mixed bag. The CLI's ability to interact with the file system and
web is powerful. But issues like hallucinated content, CLI hangs, and
inconsistent behavior show that `morpheum` still needs human oversight. While
functional, the process can be indirect and sometimes unreliable, sometimes
requiring manual workarounds (like adding the license via GitHub UI). All
commits to the repository will now be reflected with at least one comment in
this worklog to reflect the work done and any challenges encountered.
